      "      \"text\": \"This piece originally appeared on Time.com . \\nDonald Trump categorically denied multiple allegations of sexual assault Thursday, blaming the media and arguing that rival Hillary Clinton is systematically trying to destroy him.\\nSpeaking in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump argued that stories in the New York Times and People magazine were \\\"pure fiction\\\" and \\\"outright lies\\\" created to undermine his campaign. He also argued that he had \\\"substantial evidence\\\" to dispute them that he will make public later.\\n\\\"These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false. And the Clintons know it, and they know it very well,\\\" he said. \\\"These claims are all fabricated. They're pure fiction, and they're outright lies. These events never, ever happened.\\\"\\nReading off a Teleprompter at his Thursday rally, Trump barely contained his anger as his unleashed a series of allegations of his own, claiming that the media is coordinating with Hillary Clinton's campaign in an attempt to ruin his candidacy.\\nTrump responded to two allegations directly during his speech. Of Jessica Leeds, who told the Times that Trump grabbed her breasts on an airplane, Trump said: \\\"Another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.\\\" And of People writer Natasha Stoynoff, who said Trump pushed her up against a wall and kissed her without her consent while she was writing a profile, Trump seemed to imply that her looks prove he would not have wanted to kiss her.\\n\\\"Look at her, look at her words, you tell me what you think,\\\" he said. \\\"I don't think so.\\\"\\nTrump also argued that the news media is not objective, characterizing it as a \\\"special interest\\\" seeking to maintain its own privileged position at the expense of average Americans.\\n\\\"The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press. Let's be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism,\\\" he said. \\\"They're a political special interest ... and their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them, it's a war. And for them, nothing at all is out of bounds.\\\"\\n\\\"They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and your family,\\\" Trump continued. \\\"They will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. they will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that. They will do whatever is necessary.\\\"\\nThe Republican nominee then focused his ire on one publication in particular: The New York Times. (The Times published two sexual assault allegations against Trump Wednesday, as well as another piece in May that included other examples of alleged inappropriate contact between Trump and women). Trump said he is currently preparing a lawsuit against the newspaper, and threw in some insults as well: \\\"The New York Times is fighting desperately for its relevance and its financial survival,\\\" he said.\\nTrump's campaign demanded a retraction from the newspaper on Wednesday. The Times responded to the cease and desist letter, writing that the reporters \\\"worked diligently to confirm the women's accounts,\\\" and, \\\"We did what the law allows; we published newsworthy information about a subject of deep public concern. If Mr. Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight.\\\"\\nBut after getting specific with the New York Times, Trump brought his Florida speech back to broader election themes. Tying the Clinton family to the media allowed Trump to continue hammering an idea he's been teeing up before a potential loss on November 8: that the entire American political system is rigged against him and his supporters.\\n\\\"This is a conspiracy against you, the American people,\\\" he said.\",\n",

Aceste misiuni ar putea include inclusiv eliminarea liderului de la Phenian, Kim Jong-un. In timpul unui audit parlamentar, un reprezentant al armatei sud-coreene a confirmat ca fortele militare vor forma o unitate ”pentru operatiuni speciale independente” impotriva provocarilor Phenianului. In plan, este prevazuta utilizarea unor materiale perecum elicoptere MH-47, legaturi si informatii via sateliti de mici dimensiuni si arme individuale extrem de avansate. In plus, aceasta noua forta de actiune rapida, care va functiona in 2018, va fi in masura sa desfasoare ”misiuni critice fara ajutorul fortelor americane”, in contextul in care generalul de divizie Jang Kwang-hyun a declarat: ”La ora actuala, depindem mult de americani in operatiunile speciale care implica aviatia”.

      "      \"text\": \"U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Bloomington, Illinois, March 13, 2016. | Photo: Reuters Published 8 October 2016 Comments - The U.S. media and educational elites share responsibility for creating a world where a despicable idiot like Trump coud be president. \\nThe Republican man-child Donald Trump is stranger than dystopian political science fiction. He goes on bizarre rants claiming that “criminal aliens” are wreaking havoc in the United States. He says he’ll built a giant nativist wall on the nation’s southern border “and make Mexico pay for it.” \\nRELATED: Classic Trump-Grade Sexism: 'When You're a Star They Let You Do It' \\nHe says that global warming is hoax perpetrated by Chinese to harm U.S. manufacturing. He offers to pay the legal bills of white man who sucker-punched a Black protester at a Trump rally. His response to the remarkable Black Lives Matter movement and uprising? “We need law and order.” \\nHe mocks a disabled reporter. He brags about his genitalia. He insults the looks of a fellow Republican presidential candidate and those of other candidates’ wives. He suggests that women are responsible for sexual harassment in the workplace. \\nHe says the world might be a better place if Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia developed nuclear weapons. He boasts that he’d “shoot” Iranian ships if they ever again interdict “our beautiful destroyers with their little boats.” \\nHe behaves like an obnoxious teenager during his first “presidential”“debate” with Hillary Clinton – a contest for which he openly failed to prepare. He refuses to release his tax returns. When Clinton suggests that his non-payment of federal taxes over many years cost the nation money that could have been used for education and welfare, he says it shows that he’s “smart.” When Clinton noted his long record of cheating workers, he interjects to say “it was business.” \\nHe goes on a Twitter tirade against a former beauty queen – a Miss Universe he once labelled “Miss Piggy.” This wild online tantrum begins at 5 a.m. \\nHe brutally mimics a Chinese accent when he denounces China’s trade practices. He mocks Clinton for being woozy from pneumonia. \\nTrump, New York Times columnist Charles Blow recently noted , “shouldn’t be ushered into the White House; he should be laughed into hiding.” \\nHe probably won’t win . Still, at least 50 million U.S. citizens will actually mark ballots for this this vicious and moronic man-child. \\nHow did this happen? \\nAmerican Democracy Is a Shitshow \\nThe leading culprits include a Republican Party that has been trying for decades to hide its arch-plutocratic agenda behind the foul and ever more fascist-like fake populism of masculinist white nationalism; a dismal, dollar-drenched Democratic Party that has discredited liberalism and helped depress progressive constituencies by abandoning the cause of social justice in service to U.S. transnational capital; a “ liberal” professional class that has ceased to even remotely serve the working class majority against the rich; a right-wing noise machine (led by Republican talk radio, Breitbart, and FOX News) that pervades the airwaves with racist, sexist, and nationalist distortion; a wooden and understandably mistrusted Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, who epitomizes the elitist corruption and corporate takeover of the Democratic Party. \\nThe television celebrity turned presidential candidate Donald Trump is also, and fundamentally, a commercial media creation. In U.S. movies, television sitcoms, television dramas, television reality-shows, commercials, and video games, the ideal-type U.S. citizen is an idiot in the classic Athenian sense: a person who cares about little more than his or her own well-being, consumption, wealth, and status, with no concern for others and the common good. The dominant mass U.S. media’s version of Athenian idiocy “can imagine,” as Henry Giroux has written, “public issues only as private concerns.” It works to “erase the social from the language of public life so as to reduce” questions of racial and socioeconomic disparity to “private issues of … individual character and cultural depravity. Consistent with neoliberal-capitalist doctrine holding that “all problems are private rather than social in nature,” it portrays the only barriers to equality and meaningful democratic participation as “a lack of principled self-help and moral responsibility” on the part of the downtrodden. Government efforts to address and ameliorate underlying of race, class, gender, ethnicity, nationality and the like are portrayed as futile, counterproductive, naïve, and dangerous. \\nOnly a narrow and reactionary sort of public concern and engagement receives favor in this media culture. It takes the form of a cruel, often even sadistically violent response to unworthy Others seen as failing to properly obey prevalent authoritarian and neoliberal codes. U.S. corporate media celebrates and advances the portions of government that dole out punishment for the poor and attacks those perceived as nefariously resisting the corporate and imperial order at home and abroad. Police officers, prosecutors, military personnel, and vigilantes are heroes in this media. Defense attorneys, civil libertarians, environmentalists, racial justice activists, union leaders, antiwar protesters and the like are villains, Intellectuals are highly suspect and commonly mocked in this media thanks to their (alleged) tendency to side with those on the wrong side of the nation’s reigning hierarchies. \\nMeanwhile, this authoritarian media glorifies individual wealth accumulation and power while elevating narcissistic self-display of riches, beauty, and real or alleged athletic and sexual prowess. It shames the disproportionately nonwhite and urban poor, the weak, the intellectuals, and the disabled as “losers.” \\nTrump is also an epitome of the fading line between politics and entertainment that Neil Postman tried to warn us about in his book Amusing Ourselves to Death . With his adolescent taste for personal insult, “The Donald” embodies a media and politics culture that privileges looks, personality, and personal feuds over serious policy matters. His Twitter obsession both reflects and advances the onset of online corporate “social” media, where the line between private insult and public political discourse is unclear. \\nRELATED: Donald Trump is Offering US Trickle-Down Revenge \\nTrump has received a wildly undeserved windfall of free media attention from a U.S. “news” media that has obsessed over his every Tweet, grimace, and absurd statement but was barely able to cover the actually populist Bernie Sanders’ historic rallies on behalf of economic justice and democracy. \\nMeanwhile, an ever more corporate-neoliberal U.S. educational system has abandoned its mission of preparing the populace with the basic historical and civilizational knowledge and skills required for independent and critical thinking. No surprise there: the nation’s corporate masters want obedient order-takers, not free-thinking citizens. “Educators” comply. This great pedagogical collapse leaves much of the populace with no cultural filter through which to check and discard the horrific messages of the corporate media. It’s called “taking the risk out of democracy” ( Alex Carey ). \\nThe double whammy of infantilizing commercial media and fading public education helps turn untold millions of Americans into idiots in the more conventional sense. These tragically dumbed down people are too stupid and often willfully ignorant to grasp basic things like the Greenhouse Effect or the names of the world’s continents. A proud and open moron like Trump helps such Americans feel better about themselves. He shares their dark resentment for those who know about things like why some Black Americans have rioted recently and why the Arctic ice cover is melting. \\nU.S. media and educational elites roll their eyes in disgust at the vicious and embarrassing Trump phenomenon. They should take an honest look at the epic idiocy-manufacturing roles their own institutions play. They should take responsibility for a world in which a despicable idiot like Donald Trump can make a serious bid for the number one job atop the planet’s only superpower. It’s a world the U.S. corporate media and corporatized educational systems have helped make to no small degree. \\nPaul Street’s latest book is They Rule: The 1% v.

Premiul Nobel pentru literatura este insotit de un cec in valoare de circa 820.000 de euro (8 milioane de coronae suedeze). Personalitate multiculturala, Robert Allen Zimmerman, s-a nascut in 24 mai 1941, in Minnesota. Student fiind a inceput sa interpreteze cantece folk si country, schimbandu-si numele in Bob Dylan dupa cel al poetului Dylan Thomas. O parte din cele mai apreciate cantece ale lui Dylan sunt din anii ’60 (Blowin in the Wind si The Times They Are a-Changin) si au devenit embleme ale miscarilor pacifiste si pentru drepturile civile la scara mondiala. \\nUna calda, alta rece \\nEditura Humanitas, care detine drepturile de publicare pentru Dylan, spune, prin vocea Denisei Comanescu (director al Humanitas Fiction) ca decernarea premiului Nobel lui Bob Dylan ar garanta vanzari mai mari de carte de acum incolo. Cu mentiunea ca artistul american este poet si este stiut faptul ca romanii nu prea se inghesuie sa cumpere poezie. Humanitas a publicat trei tituluri de Dylan: ”Cronica vietii mele” (memorii) , ”Tarantula”, si ”Suflare de vant”, pe care le va reedita in curand. Adresa de email nu se face publica.

Serviciile secrete cheltuie milioane pe hoteluri! 2016-10-13 · 18:47:23 | Autor: Bogdan Borcea \\nDesi proprietarii si antreprenorii pietei hoteliere autohtone sustin ca afacerile lor merg din ce in ce mai rau, iata ca Serviciul Roman de Informatii s-a hotarat sa investeasca, din fonduri bugetare (5 milioane de euro!) pentru modernizarea hotelului Maramures din statiunea Olimp, care, insa, va functiona in circuit inchis. \\n\\nTot in Olimp, SRI mai detine si hotelul Crisana, renovat recent. Nici Serviciul de Informatii Externe nu sta pe loc: a cumparat hotelul Arad, din statiunea vecina, Neptun. \\nPana in 2006, hotelul Maramures a fost administrat de Regia Patrimoniului Protocolului de Stat (RA-APPS), dupa care a fost “pasat” catre Ministerul de Interne, mai precis la Institutul National de Administratie, care, la randu-i, a fost desfiintat, doi ani mai tarziu, datorita crizei financiare si a masurilor de reducere a cheltuielilor. Ulterior, cladirea, aflata in degradare, a fost preluata de directia Agentiei Nationale a Functionarilor Publici (in paralel cu M.I.), insa cheltuielile de conservare au devenit mult prea mari si, astfel, “Maramures” va fi achizitionat, prin licitatie publica, de SRI. De “proiectul de modernizare si reabilitate a caminului de garnizoana Maramures – Olimp”, vor beneficia doar salariatii SRI, impreuna cu familiile lor. Probabil, din spirit de concurenta, si Serviciul de Informatii Externe are propria locatie de relaxare, hotelul Arad, din Neptun. Adresa de email nu se face publica.

      "      \"text\": \"Justin Trudeau a lancé un sérieux avertissement aux pays de l'Union européenne (UE), jeudi, prévenant qu'un rejet de l'accord Canada-UE lancerait un message «désolant» sur la direction que souhaite prendre le groupe des 28 et remettrait carrément en cause son «utilité». «C'est un moment pour l'Europe de décider à quoi ça sert, l'Union européenne», a lancé le premier ministre du Canada en conférence de presse conjointe avec son homologue français Manuel Valls, qui a lui aussi chanté les louanges de l'accord.\\nSelon Justin Trudeau, la signature de l'Accord économique et commercial global (AECG) représente un moment charnière «dans cette situation post-Brexit où il y a plein de questionnements sur l'utilité de l'Europe».\\nSi les pays de l'Europe succombent au chant des sirènes protectionnistes et refusent de signer l'accord, cela enverra un bien mauvais signal au reste du monde, a-t-il fait valoir.\\n«Si on trouve dans une semaine ou deux, que l'Europe est incapable de signer une entente progressiste commerciale avec un pays comme le Canada, ben avec qui l'Europe pense-t-elle faire affaire dans les années à venir?», a lâché M. Trudeau.\\n«Si l'Europe n'arrive pas à signer cet accord, ça va être un message très clair - pas juste aux Européens, mais au monde entier, que l'Europe est en train de choisir une voie peut-être pas très productive ni pour ses citoyens ni pour le monde», a-t-il enchaîné.\\n«Et ce serait vraiment désolant», a offert le premier ministre canadien.\\nÀ ses côtés, Manuel Valls a pour sa part martelé que la République française était «totalement engagée dans cet accord» qu'il a qualifié de «gagnant-gagnant», contrairement à celui entre l'UE et les États-Unis, qui lui apparaît «déséquilibré» dans sa forme actuelle.\\n«Nous sommes dans un monde ouvert. Et il serait quand même inconcevable que l'Union européenne ne soit pas capable de s'engager dans un bon accord avec le Canada!», a-t-il lâché, faisant écho aux propos de son vis-à-vis canadien.\\nM. Valls a reconnu qu'il restait un travail de persuasion à faire du côté de la Belgique, où le Parlement de la Communauté française, l'une des assemblées législatives du royaume, a adopté mercredi soir une résolution qui pourrait compromettre la mise en oeuvre de l'AECG.\\n«Et faisons tout pour convaincre nos amis wallons que cet accord est une bonne chose pour le Canada et pour l'Union européenne», a-t-il assuré.\\nLe premier ministre français a conclu avec un clin d'oeil à l'intention du militant altermondialiste et eurodéputé José Bové, qui est de passage au Canada ces jours-ci afin de livrer un discours résolument anti-AECG.\\n«J'ai beaucoup de sympathie pour José Bové, mais il ne représente pas encore, que je sache, toute la France, et encore moins tout le Parlement européen», a-t-il affirmé.\\nLe prochain jalon dans le processus de ratification de l'entente de libre-échange, qui donnera au Canada un accès à ce marché de 28 États membres et ses 500 millions d'habitants, est fixé au 27 octobre prochain.\\nUne cérémonie de signature de l'AECG doit se tenir ce jour-là à Bruxelles, en Belgique, dans le cadre du sommet des dirigeants du Canada et de l'UE. Il est prévu que le premier ministre Trudeau soit sur place.\\nL'entente commerciale devra ensuite être approuvée au Parlement canadien et au Parlement européen. Lorsque les deux institutions auront dit oui - si elles disent oui -, environ 90 pour cent de l'accord sera en vigueur, selon Affaires mondiales Canada.\\nLes cinq à 10 pour cent restants sont des dispositions touchant des domaines qui relèvent de la compétence des États membres de l'UE. Ceux-ci devraient donc chacun leur tour ratifier l'accord afin que soit implantée cette dernière portion.\\nValls démolit Trump\\nAvant son arrivée sur la colline, le premier ministre Valls, qui effectuait sa première visite officielle au Canada, a reçu quelques journalistes à l'ambassade française, pour le petit-déjeuner.\\nLà, il a réitéré sa condamnation de Donald Trump.\\nIl a dit avoir évoqué l'élection américaine avec M. Trudeau au dîner de mercredi soir.\\nMais si M. Trudeau s'est toujours montré prudent quant au choix électoral des Américains, M. Valls n'a pas cette retenue.\\nIl n'a jamais caché sa préférence pour Hillary Clinton, préférence qu'il a répétée lors de son entretien avec les journalistes à l'ambassade.\\n«Comme dirigeant politique français, je souhaite évidemment que Hillary Clinton soit élue», a-t-il dit, ajoutant que si «(Barack) Obama a été un président élu par le monde», Donald Trump, lui, «est rejeté par le monde».\\nLorsqu'il a été invité (encore une fois) à se prononcer sur le candidat républicain, qui a été éclaboussé la veille par des allégations d'agressions sexuelles, le premier ministre Trudeau a de nouveau refusé de mordre à l'hameçon.\\nIl a réitéré que la relation entre le Canada et les États-Unis allait au-delà des individus qui dirigent les pays, et qu'il travaillerait avec quiconque sera élu le 8 novembre prochain.\\nLe premier ministre Trudeau a cependant conclu en y allant d'un commentaire qui laisse entrevoir le fond de sa pensée.\\n«Cela étant dit, j'ai toujours été très clair dans mon identité en tant que féministe dans mon travail pendant toute ma vie pour lutter contre le harcèlement sexuel et contre la violence faite aux femmes et je pense que je n'ai pas besoin de rien ajouter», a-t-il indiqué.\\nCe à quoi Manuel Valls a répliqué: «J'approuve», mettant ainsi fin à la conférence de presse qui se tenait au parlement.\",\n",

Aayan Hirsi Ali: «O Islão é uma religião de paz?» ; àqueles que me acusam de ser um racista primário, eu contraponho muitas vezes a minha admiração por esta senhora (os outros dois exemplos que gosto de referir são o Coronel Allen West e o Professor Thomas Sowell). Aos 22 anos, a somali Ayaan Hirsi Ali fugiu para a Holanda para escapar a uma das grandes maravilhas do Islão, os casamentos arranjados entre familiares. Hoje, Hirsi Ali é peremptória: « O Islão não é uma religião de paz ». \\n\\n\\n\\n2. Gavin McInnes: «Cinco razões para votar Donald Trump»; neste vídeo, o mais irreverente dos repórteres da canadiana Rebel Media explica porque é que Donald Trump é o melhor candidato para Presidente dos EUA e, ao mesmo tempo, desmitifica alguns pseudo-argumentos dos guerreiros da justiça social e de outros detractores do Sr. Trump. \\n\\n\\n\\n3. Christina Hoff Sommers (PhD): « A guerra aos rapazes »; mais um excelente vídeo da Doutura Sommers, desta feita acerca de um tema que me é bastante caro, mas que é abordado por muito pouca gente na blogosfera nacionalista: a feminização do homem ocidental. A Doutora Sommers explica-nos que tudo começa nas nossas escolas, onde comportamentos que eram considerados normais há algumas décadas atrás são agora implacavelmente perseguidos pela classe (des)educativa, o que acarreta graves consequências para toda a sociedade. Melhor do que isso, ela apresenta algumas soluções para o problema. \",\n",

This makes it easy for people who agree with me to judge the Republicans willing to overlook Trump’s obscene and even criminal mistreatment of women.”\\n“But what if the candidate I supported were the Trump-like character? And, hence, what if the election of a sexual predator was the only alternative to eliminating health insurance for millions, allowing runaway climate change, submitting to right-wing control of the courts, and so on? Well, then, I have to admit that I would probably hold my nose and support him anyway.”\\nThe post Would You Vote for a Sexual Predator? appeared first on Political Wire .\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"More allegations of questionable comments from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are surfacing.\\nAccording to CBS News , a video from a 1992 “Entertainment Tonight” Christmas feature was released Wednesday night in which Trump can be heard asking a young girl “You going up the escalator?” before saying, “I’m going to be dating her in ten years, can you believe it?”\\n\\nThe video was shot at Trump Tower, CBS News reports. \\nTrump has not yet commented on the video.\\nThis video comes after the 2005 video, which was released last week , in which Donald Trump was recorded on a hot mic talking about trying to have sex with a married woman, saying “when you’re a star, they let you do it.”\\nTrump was riding in an “Access Hollywood” bus with host Billy Bush, heading to the set of “Days of Our Lives” to talk about Trump’s cameo on the show.\\n“I moved on her actually, she was down in Palm Beach and I failed, I’ll admit it,” Trump says in the beginning of the video. “I did try to f*** her, she was married … and I moved on her very heavily.”\\nThe recording was made several months after Trump’s wedding with Melania, according to the paper.\\n“I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture and I told her ‘I’ll show you where you can get some nice furniture,’” Trump is heard saying. “I moved on her like a b****, and I could not get there, and she was married. And all the sudden I see her and she’s got the big phony tits, she’s totally changed her look.”\\nTrump, who has been heavily criticized for comments about women, tells Bush, “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”\\n“And when you’re a star they let you do it,” Trump says. “You can do anything.”\\n“Whatever you want,” says someone else, possibly Bush.\\n“Grab them by the pussy,” Trump says. “You can do anything.”\\nIn a statement, Trump addressed the recording, saying:\\nThis was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended. \\nIn the second presidential debate Sunday night, he was forced to address the controversy that led more than two-dozen high-profile Republicans to withdraw their support.\\nTrump seemingly dismissed the significance of the vulgar language he was caught on tape using toward women, apologizing for his conduct but repeatedly saying his remarks were just “locker room talk” that did not reflect his real character.\\n“This was locker room talk,” Trump said. “I’m not proud of it. I apologize to my family; I apologize to the American people. Certainly I’m not proud of it, but this is locker room talk.”\\nWhen co-moderator Anderson Cooper pressed Trump to say whether he’s ever actually — as he claimed in the 2005 “Access Hollywood” video — gone up to a woman to “grab her by the pussy,” Trump said, “No, I have not.”\\n \",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"People Don't Want To Stay At Trump's New DC Hotel   \\nEven though the hotel has slashed rates by 50%, no one wants to stay at Donald Trump's new Washington, D.C. hotel. \\nNew York Magazine reports : \\nLast weekend bankers and dignitaries from around the world descended on Washington for the annual World Bank–IMF meetings. But just a few days before the conference, rooms were not only still available at Trump International, they were heavily discounted. On October 2, a deluxe room, with a rack rate of $805, could be had for as low $445 a night on Hotels.com. All other five-star D.C. downtown hotels were sold out. By Wednesday, October 5, weekend stays in the deluxe rooms were marked down to $404 per night on Trump International’s own website. The more luxurious 500-square-foot executive rooms, with a city view and marble bath, were only $484. By comparison, at the Waldorf-Astoria in Georgetown, the only available rooms were $1,139 per night, according to Hotels.com. \\nFor a five-star hotel in downtown Washington to have vacancies during major IMF meetings is a little like having empty rooms when the Super Bowl is in town. “The reason why there were vacancies is the political atmosphere. People don’t want to go there for fear that they would be asked, ‘Why are you staying here?’” says Ada Pena, a travel agent with ABA Travel in Washington, D.C. The explosive tape of Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women will only “aggravate that feeling, especially when there are other options,” she says. The hotel not only has a prime location and swank interiors, it boasts a branded Ivanka Trump spa, and tourist attractions related the building’s old function as a post office. But none of that seems to be attracting guests.\",\n",

And I cant believe that Im saying that. A candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women and I have to tell you that I cant stop thinking about this.\\nIt has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldnt have predicted. So while Id love nothing more than to pretend like this isnt happening and come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous for me to move on to the next thing like this was just a bad dream.\\nThis is not something we can ignore. Its not something we can sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season. because this was not just a lewd conversation. This wasnt locker room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predator behavior. And actually bragging about kissing and globing women. Using language so obscene that many of us are worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV. To make matters worse, it now seems clear this isnt an isolated incident. Its one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life.\\nI have to tell you that I listened to all this. And I feel it so personally. And Im sure that many of you do too. Particularly the women. The shameful comments about our bodies. The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman. It is cruel. It is frightening. And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts.\\nRead more: http://www.rawstory.com/2016/10/watch-choking-back-tears-michelle-obama-delivers-powerful-speech-on-trumps-abuse-of-women/\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"Sergio Romano: «Nuova guerra fredda con la Russia? È colpa nostra. Di Putin non abbiamo capito nulla». \\nL’ex ambasciatore a Mosca: «Tutto è iniziato con l’allargamento della Nato a est. In Siria dobbiamo augurarci una vittoria di Assad. Trump? Putin sbaglia a fare il tifo per lui». di Francesco Cancellato \\n\\nPubblicato da www.linkiesta.it \\n13 Ottobre 2016 - 08:29 \\n\\n«Non è la Russia che ha paura di una guerra con l’Occidente. Semmai è il contrario: siamo noi ad avere una paura irrazionale della Russia». Sergio Romano non usa mezzi termini nel leggere le crescenti tensioni tra l’Occidente e Mosca, che hanno spinto molti commentatori a parlare di nuova guerra fredda. Secondo l’ex ambasciatore italiano in Unione Sovietica e alla Nato, le vicende degli ultimi mesi partono da molto lontano: dall’allargamento della Nato ai Paesi che facevano parte del Patto di Varsavia, alla strategia di difesa missilistica attuata da George W. Bush, alle cosiddette rivoluzioni colorate in Georgia e Ucraina, sino alla guerra in Siria. Una storia, questa, in cui si legge in filigrana la «russofobia che è insita nella nostra cultura». Una russofobia attraverso cui «vediamo solo la pagliuzza negli occhi di Putin, mentre continuiamo a non vedere la trave in quella dell’Occidente».\\nLei dice che bisogna partire da lontano, ambasciatore… \\nLa storia comincia parecchi anni fa. E per comprenderla fino in fondo bisogna provare a mettersi nei panni altrui e rendersi conto dello stato d’animo e della psicologia dell’avversario.\\nA cosa si riferisce? \\nA tante cose. Ad esempio non dovremmo dimenticare come la Russia abbia vissuto l’allargamento della Nato ai paesi che facevano parte del Patto di Varsavia e addirittura alle repubbliche baltiche che facevano parte dell’ex Unione Sovietica.\\nCome l’ha vissuto? \\nCome un atto ostile, una potenziale minaccia. Del resto, aprendo la Nato a a questi Paesi, che hanno vissuto con l’Armata Rossa in casa e che di Mosca hanno paura, ci siamo portati in casa la maggiore lobby antirussa. Peraltro, chi entra nella Nato, non entra in una qualsiasi alleanza. Entra in un alleanza fatta per combattere, con basi permanenti, un quartier generale, un comandante in capo, un presunto potenziale nemico, Un’organizzazione che ha minuziosamente predisposto un sistema di assistenza reciproca che gli Stati devono darsi. Difficile leggere questo allargamento in un’ottica che non sia ostile alla Russia.\\nChe il Cremlino lo pensi ci sta. Ma era davvero così? \\nIn parte. Alla base ci sono anche ragioni economiche. Consideri che chi entra nella Nato diventa automaticamente un cliente dell’industria bellica americana. Tuttavia concorrono a rafforzare questo timore anche altri eventi che non è facile interpretare altrimenti.\\nAd esempio? \\nQuando Bush denunciò l’accordo del 1972 sulle basi anti-missilistiche.\\nSi spieghi… \\nDurante la Guerra Fredda, Usa e Urss si accordarono per non avere più di una base anti-missilistica sui loro rispettivi territori. Questo voleva dire che dopo il primo attacco, entrambi i Paesi sarebbero stati vulnerabili e la vulnerabilità era una garanzia di pace. Bush lo denunciò nell’anno della sua scadenza e diciharò di non poterlo rinnovare perche gli Stati Uniti dovevano difendersi dagli stati canaglia mediorientali. Il problema è che le nuove basi anti-missilistiche americane, dalla Polonia alla Repubblica Ceca e alla Romania, avrebbero circondato la Russia, non l’Iran o l’Iraq. Se lei fosse stato russo come avrebbe interpretato questa strategia “difensiva”?\\nIn chiave anti-russa? \\nMi pare evidente. Così com’è evidente che le rivoluzioni colorate in Georgia e Ucraina siano siate viste con simpatia e favore dall’Occidente. Quando nel 2008 il governo georgiano decise di invadere l’Ossezia del sud, c’era sul territorio georgiano un contingente americano di 800 addestratori. Non credo che i soldati americani ignorassero quello che stava per accadere.\\nSta dicendo che anche Obama, quindi, ha mantenuto la strategia anti-russa del suo predecessore… \\nObama dette prova di una certa sensibilità. Nel 2009, a Ginevra, Hillary Clinton, allora segretario di Stato americano donò al ministro degli esteri russo Sergei Lavrov un pulsante rosso con la scritta reset. Il messaggio era chiaro: c’era la volontà americana di rendere la situazione meno tesa, di ricercare un dialogo. Obama, ad esempio, modificò la strategia di Bush accontentandosi di basi di missili intermedi. «Se dovessimo fare i conti su chi si è comportato peggio in Siria sarebbe una sfida dall’esito incerto: anche gli Usa hanno colpito un ospedale. Certo, si sono scusati. Ma basta scusarsi per emendare l’errore?» Nel 2014 però c’è stata la crisi ucraina e l’invasione russa della Crimea… \\nAnche in quel caso, però, bisogna tenere conto di altri fattori. Ad esempio, non bisognerebbe dimenticare l’intesa raggiunta col presidente filorusso Yanukovich, che aveva accettato di indire nuove elezioni. L’accordo era stato certificato dai quattro ministri degli esteri di Francia, Germania, Polonia e Regno Unito. Solo che la notte seguente a quell’accordo c’è stato il colpo di Stato in Ucraina che ha destituito Yanukovich. È stato quell’evento a far precipitare la situazione. Un atto che, a torto o ragione, Mosca ha interpretato come ostile ed eterodiretto dagli Stati Uniti. Così come del resto, il sostegno offerto ai ribelli siriani contro Assad.\\nPerché? \\nPerché la Siria è lo storico alleato dell’Urss prima e poi della Russia nel Mediterraneo. Ci sono basi siriane in cui la Russia ha mantenuto la sua flotta dopo la fine della guerra fredda. Non è sorprendente che la Russia abbia visto nella destituzione di Assad l’ennesima minaccia alla sua presenza nella regione. Per questo sta con Assad, mentre gli Usa e la Turchia - primo e secondo esercito della Nato - stanno coi ribelli. Una scelta miope, a mio avviso.\\nIn che senso? \\nAssad ha sempre avuto il sostegno degli alawiti, del partito Baath - con i suoi funzionari, militanti, clienti. Anche il 10% di popolazione cristiana stava con Assad, perché con lui viveva relativamente bene. Meglio che in una teocrazia islamica, perlomeno.\\nSembrava essere stato trovato un accordo, però. Sono stati i bombardamenti russi su Aleppo a far saltare tutto. Non potevano essere evitati? \\nAssad, da quando è sostenuto dai russi, è riuscito a volgere il conflitto a suo favore. Noi siamo molto colpiti dai bombardamenti - in buona parte russi - sulla parte di Aleppo in mano ai ribelli. Credo che Assad, però, sia disposto a rinunciare al controllo dell’intero territorio se riesce a controllare la parte della Siria che va da Damasco ad Aleppo, quella più ricca ed evoluta. I bombardamenti su Aleppo sono terribili. Ma se Assad riesce a liberare Aleppo dai ribelli ce l’ha fatta. E non è facile fermarlo ora, a un passo dalla vittoria.\\nQuindi dovremmo chiudere un occhio sulle macerie di Aleppo? \\nNo, certo. Ma se dovessimo fare i conti su chi si è comportato peggio in Siria sarebbe una sfida dall’esito incerto: anche gli Usa hanno colpito un ospedale. Certo, si sono scusati. Ma basta scusarsi per emendare l’errore?\\n«Noi continuiamo a vedere la pagliuzza negli occhi di Putin e non ci accorgiamo della trave nei nostri. Questo perché abbiamo sempre avuto apprensione nei confronti della Russia. La russofobia è nella nostra storia, nella cultura, nei luoghi comuni». L’America paga anche il suo rapporto ambiguo con l’Arabia Saudita, nella vicenda siriana? \\nL’Arabia Saudita ha sempre fatto due politiche contemporaneamente. La politica del petrolio, che esigeva rapporti di buon vicinato con i propri clienti, il primo dei quali erano gli Usa. E la politica del leader spirituale del mondo sunnita, custode dei due principali luoghi santi dell’Islam: Mecca e di Medina. Per questo ha aiutato l’Isis, che è una manifestazione dell’islam sunnita e opera in terre in cui sono presenti gli sciiti. L’Arabia è preoccupata dal disgelo tra Usa e Iran e agisce di conseguenza. Aggiungo una cosa: noi oggi parliamo di Siria perché non abbiamo abbastanza giornalisti in Yemen. Se li avessimo probabilmente leggeremmo cose che metterebbero l’Arabia Saudita in una luce non diversa da quella in cui oggi è la Russia quando bombarda Aleppo in Siria.\\nArriviamo alle ultime ore, al rafforzamento russo delle difese missilistiche sul Baltico, alla richiesta di nuove sanzioni contro Mosca da parte di Angela Merkel, ai giornali che dicono che siamo a un passo da un conflitto vero e proprio tra Occidente e Russia. \\nA me risulta che le esercitazioni di quattro battaglioni in Lettonia, Lituania e Polonia le abbia fatte la Nato, la scorsa estate. Se lei fosse dall’altra parte del confine, probabilmente dovrebbe prendere in considerazione l’ipotesi di un conflitto. Noi continuiamo a vedere la pagliuzza negli occhi di Putin e non ci accorgiamo della trave nei nostri. Questo perché abbiamo sempre avuto apprensione nei confronti della Russia. La russofobia è nella nostra storia, nella cultura, nei luoghi comuni.\\nNel frattempo Putin distribuisce carezze al candidato repubblicano Donald Trump. Quanto incide nei rapporti tra i due Paesi questa ingerenza russa sulle elezioni presidenziali americane? \\nSinceramente, faccio fatica ad attribuire a Trump delle strategie serie. Quando la Clinton parla capisco che cosa pensa, giusto o sbagliato che sia. Quando parla Trump, no. Non so nemmeno a che cosa attribuire queste professioni di amicizia per Putin. Però le frasi di Putin sono un dato di fatto. E questo getta più di un’ombra sul presidente russo. Piaccia o meno, lui è un uomo di Stato, Associando la sua figura a quella di Trump commette un grave errore. - \",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"\\nIn a sign that the Trump campaign has finally recognized the dire straits in which it finds itself, they have sought out my advice on how to prepare for the final presidential debate next week. In the interest of full disclosure, I am sharing this publicly. I have full confidence that this advice is the best path to Make Donald Trump Great Again.\\nFinal Debate Preparation Survey How would you rate Donald Trump’s takedown of Hillary during the second debate? Too strong Not strong enough Just right Other, please specify: Pathetic Should Trump continue to attack Hillary’s failures during the final debate or concentrate more on the issues? Attack Hillary’s failures Concentrate more on the issues Both equally Other, please specify: I’m surprised sexual assault is not listed as an option. Has Trump done enough to convey to American voters just how truly corrupt Hillary’s email scandal is? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: No, you should compare it to your own many corruption scandals and explain how your expertise as a corrupt businessman qualifies you to judge others’ corruption. \\nDid you agree with Trump’s decision to call for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton’s email scandal if he becomes president? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Obviously you are not becoming president so does this question even matter? \\nAre you satisfied with the way Trump has exposed the Clinton Foundation during the first two debates? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: I think you should talk more about how the Trump Foundation is far more corrupt that the Clinton Foundation as a way to emphasize how much better you are. \\nShould Trump do more to bring up Hillary’s failures in Benghazi? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: This is obviously one of the biggest non-issues that anyone has ever tried to make an issue. \\nRather than defending himself, should Trump turn those defensive moments into opportunities to attack Hillary? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: No. You really have a lot of explaining to do. I think you should spend the entire debate explaining why you shouldn’t be in jail. \\nDid Trump effectively articulate the problems with ObamaCare during the second debate? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: There are problems but it’s not like you have a clue what they are or how to fix them. \\nDo you agree with Trump’s attack of Hillary as an “all-talk, no-action” politician? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: I thought it was just “locker room talk”. Should Trump call attention to the fact that in secret paid speeches Hillary called for “open trade and open borders”? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Yes, remind everyone that Hillary is the real conservative in the race. \\nHas Trump done enough to contrast himself as an outsider with private-sector experience with Hillary’s career as a government bureaucrat? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: You should call more attention to your bankruptcies, lawsuits, tax fraud, and other ways in which you have gamed the system for your own financial advantage. \\nShould Trump call attention to Hillary’s statement that there are no systemic problems with Veteran Affairs treatment centers? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Let’s not talk veterans. You don’t want to embarrass yourself any more than you already have on that topic. \\nShould Trump bring up Hillary’s leaked audio in which she states that “the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment”? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: I guess, but the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. \\nShould Trump call out Hillary for wanting activists on the Supreme Court who have an agenda rather than judges who simply interpret the Constitution as it was written? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Don’t remind voters how scary it will be to have you appointing people to important positions. \\nShould Trump contrast his America-First mindset with Hillary’s globalist ideology? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Yes and remind voters how well that worked out when Charles Lindbergh sold that line in the 1930s. Be sure to bring up Pearl Harbor. \\nHas Trump spoken enough about veterans’ issues at the debates? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: You’ve spoken too much already. Have you thought about just not talking at all? You could always clarify where all the money that you raised for veterans went and why you have never given to veterans causes before this year and why you only did it when the media called you for lying about it. \\nShould Trump talk about the need to rebuild our military since Obama has decimated it after two terms in office? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify This would be pretty stupid since it is not true but I guess that has never stopped you before. \\nDo you think Trump should continue to tie Hillary to the last eight years of Obama’s failures? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Don’t remind people how much more popular Obama is than you. He would probably beat you by 20 or 30 percentage points. \\nHas Trump talked enough about the economy and the unique background he’ll bring to the table to fix it? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Again, the less you talk the better it will be for everyone. \\nShould Trump spend more time talking about his proven ability to create jobs? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Not unless you are going to bring up your hiring of illegal immigrants and your outsourcing to China and the fact that you frequently refuse to pay the people who work for you. This is probably not an area of strength for you. Hiring people and then refusing to pay them always reminds me of slavery. \\nHas Trump done enough to cover the importance of developing American energy? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: You’ve made it clear that you don’t need Viagra if that is the kind of energy you are talking about. \\nHas Trump done enough to justify his call for extreme vetting processes for immigrants coming from countries compromised by terrorism? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Is this the kind of extreme vetting that you do with your female employees or the kind of extreme vetting you don’t want people to do about your business career and personal finances, and history of sexual abuse? \\nShould Trump make illegal immigration an important point at this final debate? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: It’s been a pretty stupid argument all along. It’s not likely to help you now. You might mention how the country starting going downhill when we started letting in all of those Scottish immigrants. \\nShould Trump discuss the importance of cutting taxes in order to grow the economy? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: So I actually checked on this and your proposed tax plan will raise my taxes by over $2000 a year so it will just make me mad if you bring this up. \\nIn addition to attacking bad trade deals, should Trump attack the burdensome regulations that cause companies to leave America in the first place? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: No, because these are the same regulations that have allowed you to get rich in the first place. \\nShould Trump talk about law and order and the endorsements he’s received from law enforcement? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Threatening to jail people who disagree with you is always the best way to get them to change their minds. \\nDo you think Trump showed the right amount of personality during the second debate? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: If you were going for the sexual predator thing, then yes. \\nDid Trump have the right demeanor during the second debate? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: If I had been in a school cafeteria, I would have known who was getting all the lunch money. \\nDo you think Trump came off as presidential during the second debate? Yes No No opinion Other, please specify: Is this a serious question? Perhaps criminal would be a better adjective. \\n30. Is there anything Trump has not done during the first two debates that he absolutely must do during this final debate?\\nI liked the idea of you skipping the debates. It’s not too late to skip this one. How are you going to convince us that we can win when you keep losing? Maybe encourage us to just quit instead. \\nTrump’s Final Debate Preparation Survey \",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"\\nEarlier today, Donald Trump’s lawyers fired off an angry letter to The New York Times, demanding that its story about alleged sexual misconduct by Trump be pulled down immediately from its website, and that the Times issue a full retraction and apology.\\nSuch letters are standard first steps in the filing of a libel suit. Indeed, the letter from Trump’s lawyer called the story “libel per se” and warned that a refusal to meet Trump’s demands “will leave my client with no option but to pursue all available actions and remedies.”\\nThis is of course part of a pattern by Trump, who seems not to understand how our republic works. He doesn’t understand how the media can be allowed to say bad things about him. He doesn’t understand why his political opponent isn’t in prison, an oversight that like any two-bit dictator, he pledges to fix immediately upon taking office. And in a speech yesterday, he demanded to know “Why the hell is Obama allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton?”\\nBecause he can, Donald.\\nYou probably won’t be surprised to learn that the Times quickly rejected Trump’s demand for a retraction, apology, etc.. However, you might find its letter explaining that decision informative and not a little entertaining:\\n\\nAs the letter notes, “nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.” The partial recounting of those words and actions makes it pretty clear that in the extremely unlikely event that Trump pursues the case, the Times would just love the chance to put him under oath and explain these and many other incidents through depositions and before a jury.\\nI also like the closing argument:\\n“If Mr. Trump disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight.” \\nIt’s your play, Mr. Trump.\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"It is disgusting, and now a proven fact that Hillary Clinton and her surrogates are RACIST! Mr. Podesta in his comment about the \\\"Needy Latinos\\\", and the vile description of Latino Former Governor Richardson that has demeaned Governor Richardson as a \\\"male sexual organ\\\", is evidence to prove the racism of the Democratic Party, against Latinos.\\nAnd now because that email has exposed the RACISM of the Clinton Campaign, the lying, liberal media will expose Hillary Clinton and her surrogates for the RACISTS they are as proven in those emails. Because we all know how OUTRAGE the LYING, LIBERAL MEDIA can be when a person uses a sexual word,and that derogatory email about Latino Former Governor Richardson will be all over the media for the next 48 hours. Right?\\nOf course NOT, because as proven with the emails, the LYING, VILE, DISGUSTING, IMMORAL, LIBERAL MEDIA is an extension of the corrupt, and rigged system that supports lying Democratic Party Nominee Hillary Clinton. And the lying, liberal Media job is to defend and protect lying Hillary Clinton while attacking, and smearing Republican Party Nominee, Donald J. Trump.\\nOne email from African American Democratic Party Chairwoman Donna Brazile was sent to Hillary Clinton's campaign with a question about the \\\"Death Penalty\\\" in advance of the network CNN \\\"Town Hall\\\" between Democratic Party primary candidates; Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And that email proves COLLUSION between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, and that LYING, IMMORAL, VILE, LIBERAL MEDIA.\\nHillary Clinton's WALL STREET over-paid rambling speeches (in which she was paid $675,000 per speech by Wall Street for those worthless speeches), exposes the fact that 70% of Americans are correct when they calls Hillary Clinton a LIAR. Because Hillary Clinton admits that she is \\\"two faced\\\", and she has a face for her friends in private and a different face and lies for the public.\\nIn public Hillary Clinton LIES that she cares about African Americans, but in private Hillary Clinton calls African Americans \\\"Lazy\\\". But that really should not shock anyone since it was Hillary Clinton who said African Americans \\\" ... they are often kids called SUPER-PREDATORS, No conscience, No empathy, we can talk about how they ended up that way, but first we must bring them to heel\\\". A comparison to bringing a vicious dog to heel.\\nHillary Clinton calls Latinos in private, \\\" Needy\\\" and the derogatory term for a \\\"male sexual organ\\\".\\nIn private Hillary Clinton's Campaign calls the Catholic religion a \\\"bastardize\\\" religion that must be changed.\\nIn private Hillary Clinton calls women who have accused her husband of rape and sexual harassment, the derogatory names \\\"Narcissistic Loony Toon\\\", and \\\"Bimbos\\\". And her supporters call women who alleges rape or sexual harassment against repeat adulterer Bill Clinton, the derogatory word, \\\"Tramps\\\".\\nHillary Clinton calls her own supporters a \\\" Bucket of Losers\\\".\\nHillary Clinton calls Donald J.Trumps supporters a \\\"Basket of Deplorables\\\".\\nHillary \\\"Criminal Ma Barker\\\" Clinton of the \\\"Clinton Crime Family\\\" do NOT have any issues or policies to campaign on, and has resulted to pulling the 2016 Presidential Election down into the gutter, in order to hide the fact that she does NOT have any policies to help the 99% of Americans that she HATES.\\nDonald J. Trump policies include (1) More good paying Jobs by re-negotiating NAFTA and stopping TPP, (two bad trade deals that Hillary Clinton supports), and to protect the jobs in the Coal Industry that Hillary Clinton promises to destroy. (2) Improve Education with SCHOOL CHOICE. (3) Ending OBAMACARE that is over-priced and of low quality that Bill Clinton calls \\\"THE CRAZIEST THING IN THE WORLD\\\". (4) Supreme Court Judges who will defend and interpret the laws of the Constitution and NOT invent laws. (5) Secured Borders to defend America as a Sovereign Nation and to stop illegal drugs from flowing into America and destroying American lives. Donald J. Trump will \\\"Make America Great Again\\\" by restoring America's FREEDOMS.\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"The Corrupt Democrat-Media Complex Seeks Clinton Victory Posted on \\nBy: Roger Aronoff | Accuracy in Media \\nWhile the left-wing, so-called mainstream media continue to raptly discuss dissension within the Republican Party and Republicans who oppose Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, the media are quietly ignoring evidence of their own enduring and pervasive bias on behalf of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The recent WikiLeaks documents about Mrs. Clinton’s Wall Street speeches are receiving some coverage. However, few in the media want to repeat the names of those reporters who have directly promoted the Hillary campaign. \\nUsing leaked documents from Guccifer 2.0, The Daily Caller reports that campaign chairman Joel Benenson had cocktails with a number of reporters on April 10, 2015 on subjects including to “give reporters their first thoughts from team [Hillary Clinton] in advance of the announcement” and “framing the [Hillary Clinton] message and framing the race.” It was just two days later that Mrs. Clinton announced she was running for president. \\nAmong the reporters who said they were attending this cocktail party were ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, who formerly worked for Politico. One of the campaign’s memos, The Daily Caller reports, describes Haberman’s many favors for the Clintons. “We have [had] a very good relationship with Maggie Haberman of Politico over the last year. We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed,” states the memo. \\nIn other words, Haberman was, and likely still is, a “go to” journalist for reliable pro-Hillary bias. \\nStephanopoulos should have been listed by the campaign as another friendly journalist. After all, he loyally served in Bill Clinton’s White House , and, more recently, contributed $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation. We have written before about how Stephanopoulos decided not to inform viewers of his many conflicts of interest when he grilled Peter Schweizer, author of Clinton Cash , during an ABC interview. Not only did Stephanopoulos do the Clinton campaign a favor by trying to undermine Schweizer’s allegations of Clinton pay-for-play, it appears that the Clinton campaign realized how valuable his efforts were. \\n“Not to pile on, but this is therapeutic to watch,” writes Nick Merrill about the grilling to other Clinton campaign staffers, according to WikiLeaks. “George is cool as a cucumber, doesn’t rush into it, but just destroys him slowly but surely over the course of the interview…” \\nMany more reporters rsvp’d for cocktails with the Hillary campaign, including reporters from ABC, Bloomberg, CBS, CNN, The Daily Beast, The Huffington Post, MSNBC, NBC, The New Yorker, The New York Times, People, Politico, Vice, and Vox. The diverse variety of attendees demonstrates just how widely and deeply the Hillary Clinton campaign has penetrated the mainstream media. \\nWe have documented the many close family relationships between the Democrats and the establishment media, such as brothers David Rhodes (president of CBS News) and Ben Rhodes (President Obama’s deputy national security advisor). The coverage on many stories, such as the Benghazi scandals, is clearly influenced by these relationships. \\nAnother media figure, “CNBC anchor and Republican primary debate moderator John Harwood had a habit of reaching out to the campaign to offer unsolicited compliments,” reports Mediaite. Harwood sent the campaign an email with the subject line “ good letter ,” according to recently released WikiLeaks documents. He also wrote to Clinton loyalist John Podesta, “She looked so much more comfortable talking to [MSNBC’s] Andrea [Mitchell] today than to [CNN’s] Brianna [Keilar] a few weeks ago.” \\nPodesta responded that he thought Hillary was “over the hump. Knows she has to do this ad infinitum.” Harwood even reached out to ask Podesta, “How are you feeling about where things stand?” \\nWe have reported how journalists such as Jim Rutenberg of The New York Times argue that the so-called mainstream media have abandoned unbiased journalism in the face of a possible Trump presidency. Recent leaks by WikiLeaks, DC Leaks, and Guccifer 2.0 each demonstrate that the media haven’t abandoned their objectivity—they never had any in the first place. \\nConsider, for example, the leaked email that MSNBC’s Chris Hayes’ editorial producer Sheara Braun wrote in 2015 to a Clinton aide. Braun commented that MSNBC had been airing a Millennial-focused segment each night. “The point of the segment is basically to inform young people about all of the crap and nonsense that Sec. Clinton and President Clinton (but mostly Sec. Clinton) had to face back in the 90s when President Clinton was running for office… everything from cookie-gate to stand-by-your-man-gate to Hillarycare,” Braun writes. “The point isn’t to dwell on the past but the point is to talk about this amazing, intelligent woman who probably faced more nonsense back in the day because she is a woman…and she continues to have to face it. She is smarter than most men and more qualified than most men to be president.” \\n“Of course Hillary Clinton’s die-hard loyalists in the media will dislike, and find invalid, any suggestion that she engaged in any sort of questionable conduct,” wrote Glenn Greenwald for The Intercept this September. “Their self-assigned role is to defend her from all criticisms. They view themselves more as campaign operatives than journalists: Their principal, overriding goal is to ensure that Clinton wins the election.” \\nGreenwald, like much of the radical left-leaning media, is no fan of Trump. In fact, he writes in the same column, “That American journalists have dispensed with muted tones and fake neutrality when reporting on Trump is a positive development.” \\nThe fact that the mainstream media have been working to elect Clinton from the very start needs no more substantiation. These revelations follow closely behind another batch of WikiLeaks emails released just before the Democratic convention that provided other egregious examples of this corrupt alliance between the establishment, left-wing media and the Democrat Party, particularly the Clinton wing of the party. Whether fact-checking the candidates, or reporting on new political developments, it is clear that a pro-Hillary dogma permeates current press reporting.

      "      \"text\": \"share Joe Raedle/Getty Images At a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump fired back against the accusations from women that he had sexually assaulted them. He said the New York Times story claiming he had assaulted a woman on an airplane was a “totally fabricated and false story.” He seemed to imply that a People magazine reporter who accused him of kissing her against her will wasn’t attractive enough: “Take a look. You look at her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don't think so.” He said he was preparing a lawsuit against the New York Times, saying reporters “collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton campaign.” And Trump’s rants didn’t stop there. He attacked Hillary Clinton, saying she should be “locked up”; accused the “Clinton machine” of engaging in a historically unprecedented cover-up; and said Clinton “meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty.” A partial transcript follows. First, Trump attacked the “corrupt establishment” TRUMP: The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations, and lobbyists. For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind. Our campaign represents a true existential threat, like they haven't seen before. This is not simply another four-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we, the people, reclaim control over our government. The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country — has brought about the destruction of our factories, China and other countries all around the world. Our just-announced job numbers are anemic. Our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above 1 percent and going down. Workers in the United States are making less than they were almost 20 years ago, and yet they are working harder, but so am I, working harder. That I can tell you. It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to cities like Detroit, Flint, Michigan, and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and all across our country. Take a look at what's going on. They've stripped away these towns bare and raided the wealth for themselves and taken our jobs away, out of our country, never to return unless I'm elected president. The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure. We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors.” Trump told a cheering crowd Clinton “should be locked up” TRUMP: So true. Honestly, she should be locked up. She should be. Should be locked up. And likewise, the emails show that the Clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to the media organizations that she — that she, listen to this — is given the questions and answers in advance of her debate performance with Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. They definitely do not do that to me. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton campaign on helping her win the election all over. With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign. Not going to happen. Which has now become a great, great movement, the likes of which our country has never seen before, never ever. They've never seen a movement like this in our country before. Yesterday in Florida, massive crowds. People lined up outside of big arenas, not able to get in. Never happened before. It's one of the great phenomenons. It's one of the great political phenomenons. The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press. Let's be clear on one thing. The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They're a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda, and the agenda is not for you. It's for themselves. Trump said the media had “a war” against him TRUMP: And their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them, it's a war. And for them, nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. Believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it on November 8. Remember that. This election will determine whether we're a nation of only a democracy but, in fact, controlled by a handful of special global interests, rigging the system, and our system is rigged. This is reality. You know it, they know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it. The establishment and their media neighbors wield control over this nation through means that are very well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, rapist, xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you. They will slander you. They will seek to destroy your career and your family. They will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. They will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that. They will do whatever is necessary. The Clintons are criminals. Remember that, they're criminals. [Crowd chanting \\\"Lock her up.\\\"] This is well documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this. One that includes the total destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 iPhones, some by hammer, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and many, many other things. People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything. Trump said the claims against him were “absolutely false” TRUMP: And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton machine and the New York Times and other media outlets as part of a concerted, coordinated, and vicious attack. It's no coincidence these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time as WikiLeaks releases documents exposing the massive international corruption of the Clinton machine, including 2,000 more emails just this morning. These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false. And the Clintons know it. And they know it very well. These claims are all fabricated. Full of fiction and outright lies. These events never, ever happened. And the people that said them fully understand. You take a look at these people. You study these people and you'll understand also. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous, and defy truth, common sense, and logic. We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time very soon. These lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited. The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even a simple investigation would have shown that these were nothing more than false smears. Trump continued his attack on a New York Times’ story in May about his lack of boundaries with women Six months ago the failing New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me. And the central witness they used said the story was false. That she was quoted inaccurately. She said I was a great guy. She had great courage, I'll be honest with you. She was an amazing person. And never made those remarks that I was a great guy, and made the remarks. When I read the story, I was sort of surprised, how could she say that? And she didn't say it. We demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it. Just like they refused to take the comments from another source, who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said really nice things about me. They put other statements that she didn't say. They misrepresented. The story was a fraud and a big embarrassment to the New York Times. And it was a big front-page story, front page, center, color picture, a disgrace. They were very embarrassed. It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the New York Times for what they did, tell another totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago. Another ridiculous tale. No witnesses. No nothing. Trump attacked a People magazine reporter’s account of him kissing her TRUMP: Then there was a writer from People magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was beautiful. It was beautiful. It was lovely. But last night we hear that after 12 years, this took place 12 years ago, this story, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances during the interview to this writer. And I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 20 — or 12 years ago? Why wasn't it part of the story? Why didn't they make it part of the story? I was one of the biggest stars on television with The Apprentice , and I would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. Think of it, she's doing her story on Melania, who's pregnant at the time. And Donald Trump, our one-year anniversary. And she said I made inappropriate advances. And, by the way, the area was a public area. People all over the place. Take a look. You look at her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don't think so. I don't think so. But it is amazing, doing a story, a love story, on how great we are together. And by the way, we are stronger today than we ever were before, which is great. But it's a love story. It's a love story on our one-year and if I did that she would have added that, it would have been the headline. And who would have done that if you're doing this and you're one of the top shows on television? These people are horrible people. They're horrible, horrible liars. And interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election. Isn't that amazing? This invented account has already been debunked by eyewitnesses who were there. They were there. The very witness identified by the author has said the story is totally false. By the way, this is a room everybody can see in. It's got glass walls. It's at Mar-a-Lago. Can you believe this? Why wasn't it in the story? Biggest story of the year. This weekend the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the many, many emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years looking for work. Donald is great. Wanting to go to my rallies. But the New York Times, and this was a full op-ed piece, refused to use the evidence that we presented. Refused to use it. If they used it, if they would have looked, they would have said, there's no story here. Others in the media, which almost surprises me because they're dishonest also, were presented with this story by this woman numerous times. And they got very excited. But after seeing the evidence we immediately give them, all of them refused to write the story. There was no story. The Times, though, didn't want to see it. They just wrote the story. This was a full page opposite the editorials. This is part of a concerted effort led by the New York Times and others. Now, the New York Times is fighting desperately for its relevance and financial survival. And it probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook. Which wouldn't be a bad thing, if you want to know the truth. But as it winds down its years and it's becoming more and more problematic, it's gotten more and more vicious, more and more vile, and even the other mainstream media is talking about the single greatest pile-on in history and all between now and November 8. And you have to see the stories they've written. It's one after another after another. And facts mean nothing. Third-rate journalism. The great editors of the past from the New York Times and others, ladies and gentlemen, are spinning in their grave. I will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people. [Cheers and applause ] [Crowd chanting \\\"Trump\\\"] Trump claimed Clinton was behind the new allegations Thank you. Thank you. But let me state this as clearly as I can. These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. The only thing Hillary Clinton has going for herself is the press. Without the press, she is absolutely zero. And you saw that the other night in the debate where some people said she made virtually a fool of herself. This is not presidential material, believe me. What they say is false and slanderous in virtually every respect. We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime. Indeed, one of the most important elections in the history of our country. And the polls are showing us in a dead heat. Don't believe what she said. The new highly respected poll just came out this morning, just released, shows us nationally 2 points ahead, Trump. Just came out. So, now the Clinton machine has put forward a small handful of people, out of tens of thousands of people over the years that I've met, that I've worked with, that I've employed, in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense. Not even common sense. Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over our government. When I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in. Was this article helpful?\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Rocked by allegations of sexual assault, Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at his female accusers as \\\"horrible, horrible liars\\\" as the deeply divisive presidential campaign sank further into charges and countercharges of predatory treatment of women.\\nThe Republican businessman devoted much of a Florida speech to defending himself against multiple reports of inappropriate sexual behavior — accusations that he blamed on Hillary Clinton's campaign and the news media.\\n\\\"These vicious claims about me, of inappropriate conduct with women, are totally and absolutely false. And the Clintons know it,\\\" Trump declared. His accusers, he said, \\\"are horrible people. They're horrible, horrible liars.\\\"\\nThe comments came minutes after he called a reporter \\\"a sleazebag\\\" for asking whether Trump had ever touched or groped a woman without her consent.\\nFirst lady Michelle Obama, meanwhile, offered an emotional counterargument in battleground New Hampshire, warning that Trump's behavior sends a dangerous message to the nation's children.\\n\\\"The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman, it is cruel, it is frightening, and the truth is it hurts,\\\" Obama said. She added, \\\"We can't expose our children to this any longer, not for another minute, let alone for four years.\\\"\\nThe New York Times and the Palm Beach Post on Wednesday reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them. Separately, a People Magazine reporter wrote a detailed first-person account of being attacked by Trump while interviewing the businessman and his wife, Melania Trump.\\nTrump said the claims \\\"are all fabricated.\\\"\\n\\\"They're pure fiction, and they're outright lies. These events never happened,\\\" he said at the West Palm Beach rally.\\nHe added, \\\"I will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies.\\\"\\nAt the same time, Trump's flailing campaign signaled it would spend the election's final month relitigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as what Trump says is Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's role in intimidating the women who were involved.\\nThe developments come less than a week after the publication of a 2005 recording in which the Republican nominee boasted of using his fame to kiss and grab women without their consent.\\nIn an interview broadcast Thursday, the soap opera actress in the video said Trump's comments were offensive. But actress Arianne Zucker, on NBC's \\\"Today,\\\" said she wasn't shocked, given \\\"that type of personality.\\\"\\nThe revelation of the video last Friday prompted many Republicans to withdraw their support for Trump — with some calling for him to drop out of the race — though a handful have since switched back to supporting him.\\nClinton adviser Jennifer Palmieri said the latest revelations match \\\"everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women.\\\"\\nTaken together, the stories about Trump and his retorts about Bill Clinton have plunged an already rancorous campaign to new lows. The real estate mogul has also aggressively charged that Hillary Clinton not only needs to be defeated in November but also imprisoned: \\\"Honestly, she should be locked up,\\\" he said Thursday.\\nAnd his campaign is facing questions about ties to Russian interests accused of hacking Democratic groups, as well as the hacking of a top Clinton adviser's emails.\\nFor Trump, the cumulative effect appears to be a tumble in the battleground states he needs to win in November. What was already a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory is virtually indiscernible for Trump unless there's a significant shake-up in the race between now and Nov. 8\\nRather than trying to make up ground by shifting attention back to issues like trade that have energized Trump backers and could appeal to new voters, the Republican campaign appears to be moving swiftly to make Bill Clinton's past a centerpiece of its campaign.\\nBuilding on Trump's decision to bring three Bill Clinton accusers to last week's presidential debate, the Republican nominee is expected to have the women appear with him on stage at rallies and do television interviews, according to a person briefed on the plan but not authorized to discuss it publicly. They were not on stage in West Palm Beach.\\nThe Trump campaign's hope is to showcase the decades-old accusations to young voters, particularly women, who may not have been old enough to remember the controversies that dogged the Clintons in the 1990s. If the campaign can't get them to vote for Trump, the hope is that they will stay home and depress turnout, which would likely hurt Democrats.\\nBut it's unclear whether Trump's strategy is even aimed at winning the election at this point.\\nIncreasingly, Trump's campaign feels like an opportunity for longtime Clinton opponents to air decades worth of grievances about the Democratic power couple on the biggest stage in American politics.\\nTrump confidant and informal adviser Roger Stone has long encouraged Trump to make Bill Clinton's alleged assaults and the way his wife treated his accusers a centerpiece of the campaign. Steve Bannon, the campaign's chief executive, ran Breitbart News, a conservative website that eagerly promotes conspiracy theories about the Clintons.\\nHillary Clinton, who is on pace to become America's first female president if her lead holds, has tried to stay above the fray. She has yet to respond directly to Trump's decision to resurrect accusations about her husband.\\nBack in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama said, \\\"Enough is enough.\\\"\\n\\\"This has got to stop right now. Because consider this: If all of this is painful to us as grown women, what do you think this is doing to our children?\\\"\\nAP writers Jonathan Lemire in Doral, Florida, and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"share Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images When the New York Times published its blockbuster story chronicling two women’s on-the-record accounts of being sexually assaulted by Donald Trump , they basically guaranteed the Trump campaign, and Trump himself, would go to war. Trump's campaign lawyer sent a letter to Times executive editor Dean Baquet that very night threatening a lawsuit if the paper did not retract the story, accusing the paper of being \\\"willing to provide a platform to anyone wishing to smear Mr. Trump’s name and reputation.” The Times’ own general counsel David E. McCraw has now responded, saying, in effect, that Trump's reputation was already too horrible for anything the paper writes to possibly worsen it. \\\"The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one's reputation,” he writes. “Mr. Trump has bragged about his non-consensual sexual touching of women … Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself.\\\" NYT declines to remove story, per letter from general counsel to Trump lawyer pic.twitter.com/5LBpjsCC3w — Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) October 13, 2016 You can read the full letter here. McCraw’s letter is remarkable, in that it picks up on one of the most striking things about this scandal: Trump is lashing out at women and the press, and calling them liars, for accusing him of doing things he was caught on tape bragging about doing. His reputation, through his decades of public misogyny , is of someone who targets women, who harasses them, and who treats them unfailingly as sex objects, even when they’re children or his own daughter . The Times’ report did not damage that reputation. It confirmed it. Watch: Women accusing Trump of sexual assault Was this article helpful?\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"By Amanda Wicks \\nIt seems like Donald Trump is rather limited when it comes to what music he can use at his rallies, since few artists and bands want to be associated with the Republican presidential candidate. Not the Rolling Stones, not Adele, not Queen, not the estate of George Harrison. Not even the Backstreet Boys.\\nRelated: Backstreet Boys Announce Las Vegas Residency \\nThe boy band is the latest to speak out against Trump’s use of their song during a rally in Ocala, Florida. On Wednesday (Oct. 12), Trump reportedly played their 1999 hit single, “I Want It That Way,” many times. And the Backstreet Boys were none too happy about it. “[The Backstreet Boys] did not approve this and we are not associated with the Trump camp,” the group’s publicist Steven Trachtenbroit emailed The Daily Beast . \\nFor those musicians who have politely asked Trump’s camp to stop using their songs, they’ve continued to be ignored. In July, Trump once again played the Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” even though he was asked to not use their music.\\nIt doesn’t seem like the Backstreet Boys have taken any legal action, like a cease and desist letter, but simply want to make sure their fans are clear: They do not want it Trump’s way.\",\n",

Maxwell Tani/Business Insider \\nMichelle Obama on Thursday unleashed on Donald Trump over the various sexual-assault controversies looming over his campaign. \\nAt a campaign event in New Hampshire, the first lady delivered an lengthy, emotional speech condemning Trump's lewd 2005 statements boasting about grabbing and kissing women without their permission. \\nObama characterized Trump's comments that he could \\\"grab women \\\"by the p---y\\\" as \\\"so shocking, and so demeaning, that I simply will not repeat anything here today.\\\" \\n\\\"I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted,\\\" Obama said. \\nShe added: \\\"So while I'd love nothing more than to pretend that this isn't happening, and to come out here and give my normal campaign speech, it'd be dishonest and disingenuous for me to just move on the to the next thing like it's a bad dream.\\\" \\nThe first lady said the comments, as well as new allegations of sexual misconduct from several different women against Trump, amounted to \\\"sexually predatory behavior.\\\" \\nObama used examples of harassment in the workplace, in school, and in everyday interactions to illustrate what she perceived as the danger of Trump's candidacy. \\n\\\"The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, belief that you can do anything you want to a woman,\\\" Obama said. \\\"It is cruel. It is frightening. And the truth is it hurts. It's like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you're walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body. Or like that guy at work who stands a little too close, stares a little too long.\\\" \\nShe also attempted to reach out to men and members of other political parties, suggesting that many men were \\\"sickened\\\" by Trump's dismissal of his comments as \\\"locker room talk.\\\" \\n\\\"This is disgraceful. It's intolerable. It doesn't matter what party you belong to — Democrat, Republican, Independent, no woman deserves to be treated this way. No woman deserves that kind of abuse.\\\" \\nShe added: \\\"To dismiss this as innocent locker room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere. The men that you and I know don't treat women this way.\\\" \\nObama has made empowering women and girls a major part of her advocacy as first lady. She founded an official summit on women's issues earlier this year and established the \\\"Let Girls Learn\\\" initiative dedicated to increasing education for women across the globe.\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"share Joe Raedle/Getty Images Donald Trump denied a People magazine journalist’s claim that he sexually assaulted her during an interview. His explanation: She’s not attractive enough. On Wednesday, People magazine journalist Natasha Stoynoff alleged that Trump tried to forcibly kiss her while she was on assignment. She wrote that Trump brought her into a room, shut the door, “and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat.” On Thursday, Trump said it wasn’t true. “Look at her,” Trump said during a speech. “Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don't think so.” This kind of objectification is part of a very long pattern for Trump. As Libby Nelson explained for Vox , Trump seems to only show his feelings about women based on their physical characteristics or sexuality: \\nTrump is incapable of separating a woman’s value from her physical appearance. He assumes that his intimate commentary on women’s bodies is always welcome, no matter who might be listening — as the leaked audio, in which Trump is having a conversation with an acquaintance in a professional setting, demonstrates. \\nHe apparently never stops to consider how the women he’s subjecting to all of this might feel. In a professional setting, it’s degrading to know that people are paying more attention to your looks than your abilities or achievements. It’s gross for your boss to tell you you’re beautiful, or for a man with more power than you to speculate about what you’re like in bed. It’s dehumanizing to be reduced to a set of breasts and a pretty face. It is such an inherent part of Trump’s character, apparently, that he can’t even stop himself from doing it when he’s being criticized for it.

      "      \"text\": \"Donald Trump’s past tweets about rape and sexual misconduct seem even worse now The sexual assault allegations against Trump put these tweets in a new light. Donald Trump once suggested that sexual assault and rape in the military is not the fault of the men doing the attacking, but the fault of the military for putting men and women together. Seriously. Here’s the tweet: 26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2013 The tweet has gotten a lot of attention in recent days as we’ve found out some truly disturbing things about Trump’s history with women. Last week, the Washington Post published leaked audio footage in which Trump essentially bragged that he can sexually assault women — “grab ’em by the pussy” — because he’s a celebrity. And in the past couple of days, seven women have come out with allegations that Trump forcibly kissed and groped them. The tweet adds another disturbing layer to Trump’s comments and the allegations: It shows a very pervasive attitude toward sexual assault in America. It suggests that it’s only natural for men to sexually assault or advance on women if men and women are placed in the same environment for long periods of time. Trump suggested as much in his 2004 book How to Get Rich: “ All the women on The Apprentice flirted with me — consciously or unconsciously. That’s to be expected. A sexual dynamic is always present between people, unless you are asexual.” Basically, in Trump’s view, it’s not a man’s — or perhaps Trump’s — problem that he sexually harasses or assaults women. It’s nature’s. And this isn’t the only time Trump has tweeted about sexual misconduct. “The WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history” Trump has also long criticized Bill Clinton for abusing his power to allegedly sexually assault women — exactly what Trump is accused of now. Take these tweets from the past year: Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 17, 2016 There’s never been anyone more abusive to women in politics than Bill Clinton.My words were unfortunate-the Clintons’ actions were far worse — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2016 He also tweeted a lot about former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY), who’s repeatedly gotten into trouble over the years for going around his wife and sexting with other women. Here are just a few examples: Degenerate former Congressman Anthony Weiner is trying to make a comeback. He is a sick & perverted man that New York does not want or need. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2012 Scary thought--what is the pervert Anthony Weiner doing with all the free time he has. Does he collect unemployment? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2012 Pervert alert! Sexter Anthony Weiner will be running for Mayor of New York City. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2013 There’s some hypocrisy here. In the early 1990s, Trump cheated on his first wife, Ivana Trump, with Marla Maples, who later became his second wife. Then again, Trump ghost writer Tony Schwartz once tweeted that “most negative things [Trump] says about others are actually describing him. Read his tweets with that in mind.” Watch: These women are accusing Trump of sexual assault Was this article helpful?\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"WASHINGTON \\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is in a pickle. \\nThe senior Kentucky Republican began the year with a tough Senate electoral map. A wildly unpredictable Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has possibly made that map even harder. \\nWhen conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in February, McConnell made the calculation that waiting for the election of a Republican president to name a successor would be better than letting the incumbent Democrat, Barack Obama, do so. \\nJust two years ago, McConnell became the first Kentuckian to lead a Senate majority since Democrat Alben W. Barkley in the 1940s. But now, largely due to circumstances beyond his control, McConnell stands to lose a perch he’s coveted his whole career. \\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton is poised to be elected president, and she would get to fill the current Supreme Court vacancy, and perhaps others, with a majority in the Senate to confirm them. \\nStill, McConnell thinks long term, and he would still wield considerable influence as minority leader, as he did from 2009 to 2014. And it may be possible for him to lead Republicans back into the majority in two years. \\nAs minority leader, he was quite skilled at figuring out how to regain control of the Senate. He knows how to exploit the rules of the game to his advantage quite well. Sarah Binder, George Washington University \\n“As minority leader, he was quite skilled at figuring out how to regain control of the Senate,” said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University who’s an expert on Congress. “He knows how to exploit the rules of the game to his advantage quite well.” \\nAs Trump’s troubles have tied other Republican leaders, namely House Speaker Paul Ryan, in knots, McConnell has kept a low profile, not rushing to defend his party’s nominee but not engaging in open conflict with him either. \\n“I’d say he’s done better,” Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky, said of McConnell. “Paul Ryan has made a repeated spectacle of working through handling the Trump thing.” \\nI’d say he’s done better. Paul Ryan has made a repeated spectacle of working through handling the Trump thing. Stephen Voss, University of Kentucky \\nIt’s all part of a patient approach to politics McConnell has built for nearly five decades. \\nRep. John Yarmuth, Kentucky’s lone Democrat in Congress, has known McConnell since 1968, when both worked on the campaign of Kentucky Sen. Marlow Cook, a moderate Republican. Both later served on Cook’s staff. \\nMcConnell ran for county executive in Jefferson County, the state’s largest and a stronghold for Democrats, and won two terms. With the help of an ambitious media consultant named Roger Ailes, McConnell challenged an incumbent Democrat for the U.S. Senate, and was elected on his first try in 1984. \\nMcConnell relishes his role as a Senate power broker, Yarmuth said. \\n“He’s not interested in policy. He’s interested in partisan power,” he said. “I don’t think it matters to him the position he holds.” \\nDemocrats need to win five seats to gain a simple majority in the Senate, and they have a shot. \\nDemocrats need to win five seats to gain a simple majority in the Senate, and they have a shot among nine states in which races could go either way. \\nAccording to the nonpartisan Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report , three seats are pure toss-ups: two held by Republicans, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, and one held by a Democrat, Nevada. \\nThree others held by Republicans – Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin – are more favorable to Democrats. Three more Republican seats – Missouri, Florida and North Carolina – are more favorable to Republicans. \\n“A shift of 2 to 4 points in key Senate races, and the majority would be gone,” said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report. \\nA shift of 2 to 4 points in key Senate races, and the majority would be gone. Nathan Gonzales, Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report \\nNew York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, an outspoken liberal, would become majority leader and would get to set the agenda, as McConnell does now. \\nBut as leader of a Republican minority, McConnell would be no shrinking violet. \\nAlmost nothing gets done in the Senate without 60 votes. At best, Democrats could start next year with 53 or 54 votes, including those of two independents. \\nAs minority leader, McConnell could serve as a check on the ambitions of Schumer or a Democrat in the White House. \\n“You can stop anything you want to stop,” Yarmuth said. “If you assume a Hillary Clinton presidency, you’re in a stronger position to affect policy.” \\nYou can stop anything you want to stop. If you assume a Hillary Clinton presidency, you’re in a stronger position to affect policy. Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky. \\nThat could include matters of immigration, health care, taxes, the environment, voting rights – conceivably anything Democrats would like to accomplish. \\n“The intensity of partisanship in Congress is not going away anytime soon,” Binder said. \\nWith Clinton widening her lead over Trump, it appears increasingly likely that it is she who will appoint at least one, if not more, justices to the Supreme Court. \\nWhile a rule change instituted when Democrats controlled the Senate enables the chamber to consider judicial nominees in lower courts with a simple majority, Supreme Court justices still require 60 votes. That’s where McConnell could exert a lot of influence. \\nLiberal dreams of resurrecting a modern version of the court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren 50 years ago could be premature. \\nLiberal dreams of resurrecting a modern version of the court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren 50 years ago could be premature. \\n“The Senate is your one place, at least at the Supreme Court level, to fight Democratic appointees, to force them toward the middle,” said. \\nThen comes 2018, when the Democrats will be the ones facing the challenging map – perhaps even worse than the one Republicans have this year. \\nThis year, Republicans are defending 24 seats to Democrats’ 10. In two years, Democrats will be defending 25 seats to Republicans’ eight. \\n“The media is going to try to declare the death of the Republican Party on Nov. 8,” Rothenberg said. “But Republicans will have a great opportunity to bounce back in the midterms with a Democrat in the White House.”  ;\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"'Absolutely false,' Trump says of allegations of inappropriate behaviour with women | Reuters Reuters Updated: Oct 14, 2016 00:00 IST \\nBy Steve Holland | WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. Donald Trump on Thursday angrily denied several accusations of groping in a growing controversy over inappropriate behaviour with women that is damaging the Republican presidential candidate's chances of winning the Nov. 8 U.S. election.Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the New York Times and other media were engaged in a concerted, \\\"vicious\\\" attempt to stop him, Trump told a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida. \\\"These claims are all fabricated. They're pure fiction and they're outright lies. These events never, ever happened,\\\" Trump said, adding he would make public at some point evidence to dispute the claims.\\\"These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false. And the Clintons know it and they know well.\\\"Trump spoke after the New York Times reported on Wednesday evening that two women had endured sexual aggression from Trump, and several other women made similar allegations in other media outlets, putting more pressure on Trump as he lags Clinton in national opinion polls. Trump's campaign was already struggling to contain a crisis after a video surfaced last week showing him bragging in 2005 about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances.One woman, Jessica Leeds, appeared on camera on The New York Times' website to recount how Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight from the Midwest to New York in or around 1980. (nyti.ms/2dx8k5R)The second woman, Rachel Crooks, described how Trump \\\"kissed me directly on the mouth\\\" in an unwanted advance in 2005 outside the elevator in Trump Tower in Manhattan, where she was a receptionist at a real estate firm.On Wednesday night, Trump's campaign made public a letter to the newspaper from a lawyer representing Trump, demanding it retract the story, calling it libelous, and threatening legal action if it did not comply.\\\"This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,\\\" the Trump campaign's senior communications adviser, Jason Miller, said in a statement.Reuters could not independently verify the incidents. Leeds and Crooks did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.The New York Times said on Thursday it stood by its story and rejected claims the article was libelous.\\\"Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself,\\\" said David McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel for the newspaper, in a letter to Trump's lawyer.If Trump disagrees that the story was libelous, \\\"we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight,\\\" McCraw said. \\nThe Times report came just two days after a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed one in five Republicans thought Trump's comments about groping women disqualified him from the presidency. The poll also showed him 8 points behind Clinton among likely voters. Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV star, has never previously run for political office. Controversy has stalked his White House campaign since the day in June 2015 when he announced he was running for president, describing Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals in a speech.Establishment Republicans have struggled to get behind Trump, alarmed by both his style and some of his policy proposals.MORE ACCOUNTS SURFACE Within hours of The New York Times report, several other media outlets published similar reports. People magazine published a detailed first-person account from one of its reporters, Natasha Stoynoff. (bit.ly/2dTm90D)Stoynoff said Trump pinned her against a wall at his Florida estate in 2005 and kissed her as she struggled to get away. \\n\\\"I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat,\\\" Stoynoff said. Trump, 70, denied the People story in a Twitter message and in his speech in Florida on Thursday, and mocked the writer.\\\"I ask her a simple question. Why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago. Why didn't they make it part of the story ...if she had added that it would have been the headline.\\\"\\\"Look at her and look at her words,\\\" he said. \\\"You tell me what you think. I don't think so.\\\"The Palm Beach Post reported a claim by Mindy McGillivray, 36, a woman in South Florida, that Trump had grabbed her bottom 13 years ago while she was working at his Mar-a-Lago estate as a photographer's assistant.\\\"There is no truth to this whatsoever,\\\" Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Post. McGillivray could not be reached for comment. \\nCLOUD OVER REPUBLICAN HOPES In the 2005 video, Trump bragged about groping women, kissing them without permission, and trying to seduce a married woman. He said during a presidential debate on Sunday that he had not actually done the things he had boasted about, and apologised for his remarks, which he called private \\\"locker room talk.\\\"The video has thrown a cloud over Republican hopes of retaining control of the U.S. Congress and deeply split the party as a slew of elected officials have abandoned support for the candidate.U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Monday he was no longer going to campaign for or defend Trump. Trump has veered since between pronouncing himself free to campaign as he likes, and expressing fury at Ryan and other \\\"disloyal\\\" Republicans.First lady Michelle Obama condemned Trump in scathing terms during a campaign speech for Clinton in New Hampshire. \\\"This is not normal. This is not politics as usual. This is disgraceful. It is intolerable. It doesn't matter what party you belong to - Democrat, Republican, independent. No woman deserves to be treated this way,\\\" she said.A spokeswoman for Clinton, 68, said Wednesday's report in the New York Times was \\\"disturbing.\\\"\\\"These reports suggest that he lied on the debate stage and that the disgusting behaviour he bragged about in the tape is more than just words,\\\" said spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri.The Washington Post endorsed Clinton on Thursday. \\\"In the gloom and ugliness of this political season, one encouraging truth is often overlooked: There is a well-qualified, well-prepared candidate on the ballot ... we endorse her without hesitation,\\\" it said. One of Trump's highest-profile Republican supporters, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, received a blow on Thursday when a judge allowed a citizen's criminal complaint against him over the \\\"Bridgegate\\\" scandal to move forward. Christie allies were accused of deliberately causing a massive traffic jam in 2013 by closing access lanes to a bridge in order to punish a mayor.Christie heads Trump's transition team, which would work on the handover from President Barack Obama if Trump won the election.

      "      \"text\": \"Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \\nTHE ISSUE: Voters are disgusted with the way political races are paid for — disproportionately by big-money donors, including those who stand to gain or lose from government decisions. The rules even allow donors to hide their identities by giving to politically active nonprofit groups that don't file detailed public paperwork about their finances. \\nThe system leaves everyday Americans fearing their voices are being drowned out by these moneyed interests. \\nHere's one example of how that can happen: Hillary Clinton headlined more closed-door fundraisers in August than there were days of the month. The spree left her with a record amount of money, but at the expense of spending time with voters. \\nTo be sure, donors are necessary; they pay the ever-increasing tab for campaigns. So far, donors have pumped more than $1.7 billion into the presidential race, according to an Associated Press tally of election and advertising records. \\nOutside groups that face no contribution limits account for about one-third of that total. Money has been pouring into those groups ever since the 2010 Supreme Court decision in a case known as Citizens United. That ruling and subsequent court decisions and regulatory changes made it clear to wealthy donors that they can give as much as they'd like, so long as the candidates themselves aren't controlling how that money gets spent. \\nIt's enough to make some candidates say they want to throw the whole system out and start fresh. \\n--- \\nWHERE THEY STAND \\nBoth presidential candidates talk a good game when it comes to money in politics, but both fail to back their words with action. \\nClinton, a Democrat, says she'd like to get \\\"unaccountable money out of politics.\\\" She has vowed to \\\"overturn\\\" Citizens United — something she cannot directly do as president — either by nominating Supreme Court justices who would rule differently or proposing a constitutional amendment to undo it. It's extremely difficult to amend the founding document. She also has called upon Congress to require outside groups to disclose \\\"significant\\\" political spending. That's a murky request unlikely to go anywhere in a divided Congress. \\nRepublican Donald Trump has denounced \\\"corrupt\\\" outside groups and disparaged his rivals as \\\"puppets\\\" of big donors. Yet he has not proposed any policies that would change the campaign finance system. \\nMeanwhile, Clinton and Trump have both sought out major donors in this costly presidential race. Each flouts the $2,700-per-donor contribution limit by partnering with their respective parties, which can accept far more money than the candidates can on their own. And both benefit from multimillion-dollar super PACs and their even more controversial cousins, groups that don't disclose their donors at all. \\n--- \\nWHY IT MATTERS \\nConcern about money in politics has been on vivid display throughout the 2016 race. \\nIn the primaries, Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders used unconventional methods to highlight their stated aversion to the influence of wealthy donors. Sanders, a Vermont senator, fueled his upstart bid with small contributions made mostly online by millions of supporters. It was a crowd-sourcing antidote to big money in politics. \\nTrump, a businessman who says he has billions of dollars at his disposal, was able to largely eschew donors during the GOP primary by writing his own checks. In all, he has put more than $50 million into his presidential bid. In the general election, he's been stingier with his own money. He's better than Clinton at raising \\\"Sanders-style\\\" money, but he also now pursues the same major donors he once dismissed. \\nNegative views on money in politics transcend party lines. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey last year found that nearly nine in 10 respondents thought that limiting outside spending would curb the influence of money in politics at least somewhat, and more than half see outside groups such as super PACs as an unacceptable way to finance politics. \\nAction remains elusive, even though both candidates claim they want things to change. \\n--- \\nThis story is part of AP's \\\"Why It Matters\\\" series, which is examining three dozen issues at stake in the presidential election between now and Election Day. You can find them at: http://apne.ws/2bBG85a \\n--- \\nKeep track on how much Clinton and Trump are spending on television advertising, and where they're spending it, via AP's interactive ad tracker. http://elections.ap.org/content/ad-spending \\nEDITOR'S NOTE - One in an AP series examining issues at stake in the presidential election and how they affect people Related content\",\n",

Maxwell Tani/Business Insider \\nMichelle Obama on Thursday unleashed on Donald Trump over the various sexual-assault controversies looming over his campaign. \\nAt a campaign event in New Hampshire, the first lady delivered an lengthy, emotional speech condemning Trump's lewd 2005 statements boasting about grabbing and kissing women without their permission. \\nObama characterized Trump's comments that he could \\\"grab women \\\"by the p---y\\\" as \\\"so shocking, and so demeaning, that I simply will not repeat anything here today.\\\" \\n\\\"I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted,\\\" Obama said. \\nShe added: \\\"So while I'd love nothing more than to pretend that this isn't happening, and to come out here and give my normal campaign speech, it'd be dishonest and disingenuous for me to just move on the to the next thing like it's a bad dream.\\\" \\nThe first lady said the comments, as well as new allegations of sexual misconduct from several different women against Trump, amounted to \\\"sexually predatory behavior.\\\" \\nObama used examples of harassment in the workplace, in school, and in everyday interactions to illustrate what she perceived as the danger of Trump's candidacy. \\n\\\"The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, belief that you can do anything you want to a woman,\\\" Obama said. \\\"It is cruel. It is frightening. And the truth is it hurts. It's like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you're walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body. Or like that guy at work who stands a little too close, stares a little too long.\\\" \\nShe also attempted to reach out to men and members of other political parties, suggesting that many men were \\\"sickened\\\" by Trump's dismissal of his comments as \\\"locker room talk.\\\" \\n\\\"This is disgraceful. It's intolerable. It doesn't matter what party you belong to — Democrat, Republican, Independent, no woman deserves to be treated this way. No woman deserves that kind of abuse.\\\" \\nShe added: \\\"To dismiss this as innocent locker room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere. The men that you and I know don't treat women this way.\\\" \\nObama has made empowering women and girls a major part of her advocacy as first lady. She founded an official summit on women's issues earlier this year and established the \\\"Let Girls Learn\\\" initiative dedicated to increasing education for women across the globe.\",\n",

Maxwell Tani/Business Insider \\nMichelle Obama on Thursday unleashed on Donald Trump over the various sexual-assault controversies looming over his campaign. \\nAt a campaign event in New Hampshire, the first lady delivered an lengthy, emotional speech condemning Trump's lewd 2005 statements boasting about grabbing and kissing women without their permission. \\nObama characterized Trump's comments that he could \\\"grab women \\\"by the p---y\\\" as \\\"so shocking, and so demeaning, that I simply will not repeat anything here today.\\\" \\n\\\"I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted,\\\" Obama said. \\nShe added: \\\"So while I'd love nothing more than to pretend that this isn't happening, and to come out here and give my normal campaign speech, it'd be dishonest and disingenuous for me to just move on the to the next thing like it's a bad dream.\\\" \\nThe first lady said the comments, as well as new allegations of sexual misconduct from several different women against Trump, amounted to \\\"sexually predatory behavior.\\\" \\nObama used examples of harassment in the workplace, in school, and in everyday interactions to illustrate what she perceived as the danger of Trump's candidacy. \\n\\\"The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, belief that you can do anything you want to a woman,\\\" Obama said. \\\"It is cruel. It is frightening. And the truth is it hurts. It's like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you're walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body. Or like that guy at work who stands a little too close, stares a little too long.\\\" \\nShe also attempted to reach out to men and members of other political parties, suggesting that many men were \\\"sickened\\\" by Trump's dismissal of his comments as \\\"locker room talk.\\\" \\n\\\"This is disgraceful. It's intolerable. It doesn't matter what party you belong to — Democrat, Republican, Independent, no woman deserves to be treated this way. No woman deserves that kind of abuse.\\\" \\nShe added: \\\"To dismiss this as innocent locker room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere. The men that you and I know don't treat women this way.\\\" \\nObama has made empowering women and girls a major part of her advocacy as first lady. She founded an official summit on women's issues earlier this year and established the \\\"Let Girls Learn\\\" initiative dedicated to increasing education for women across the globe.\",\n",

Qualcuno azzarda che le ultime settimane prima del voto Trump le vivrà di fatto da candidato indipendente. Priebus avrebbe definito le scuse di Trump sul video sessista \\\"sincere\\\" e messo in evidenza come il problema sia stato affrontato durante il dibattito. Tutti i sondaggi esaminati mostrano che Hillary Clinton ha un vantaggio molto consistente su Donald Trump fra le elettrici donne: uno dei sondaggi diffusi più di recente, pubblicato dall'Atlantic , mostra Clinton avanti addirittura avanti di 33 punti fra le donne. In un altro stato chiave almeno da decenni per la scelta del presidente Usa, ovvero in Ohio, secondo lo stesso sondaggio Clinton vanta un sorpasso di 9 punti.\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"Tim Kaine on “The View”: Trump Accusers Shocking, But Not Surprising   Political News \\nMichael Davidson for Hillary for America (NEW YORK) — In an appearance on ABC’s The View , Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine discussed the accusations by a growing number of women alleging that Trump inappropriately touched or kissed them, calling the accusations “shocking,” but not surprising. \\nKaine has previously called Trump’s apology for foul-mouthed remarks made in a 2005 Access Hollywood video insincere. In the video, Trump described making moves on women. Some, including Kaine, have described Trump’s remarks about what he does to women as abusive. Trump has defended his remarks as just words and “locker room” banter. \\n“I guess I was shocked but not surprised. I mean the tape kind of made me sick to my stomach, but if you’ve been following things that he’s been saying during his career and during the campaign, it wasn’t completely surprising. I was surprised on stage Sunday night when he said, ‘I just said that, I never did it.’ Because I felt like, okay, well how many days is it going to be until folks are coming out and saying, that’s exactly the way he treated me, and now we’re seeing that happen,” Kaine told The View . \\nHillary Clinton’s running mate added, “So, not surprised but it is shocking, and especially that he is the nominee and this stuff is coming out.” \\nOver the past 24 hours, a number of reports have been published of women claiming Trump inappropriately kissed them or groped them. A Trump campaign spokesman has denied the allegations, calling one of the reports published in The New York Times “fiction” and “completely false.” Trump’s attorneys have called for a retraction and threatened a lawsuit against The Times . \\nWhile dishing with the ladies of The View , Kaine was also asked about his reaction to Trump using Bill Clinton’s past infidelity as an issue in the 2016 election. \\n“Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the two on the ballot. I mean, that’s the relevant comparison,” Kaine said. “After Donald lost the first debate he said, okay, now I’ve got to make the Clinton’s marriage an issue. It’s not an issue for the voters. He can run the campaign he wants.” \\nPrior to the most recent debate between Trump and Clinton, Trump held a news conference with women who have accused Bill Clinton of inappropriately touching them. \\n“That took it to the next level,” said Kaine of Trump holding the news conference with Bill Clinton’s accusers. \\n“It was a weird circumstance for her to walk into and I think what voters were looking at was, you know, how can you handle it, I mean, and she handled it like somebody who’s got the temperament and the judgment to do the job, and that was what I really appreciated,” Kaine said. \\nKaine was also pressed about whether the contents of some of the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks raises more questions about whether Clinton is trustworthy. \\n“First thing on the WikiLeaks, the FBI and the director of national intelligence has said that this is hacking that Russians are behind it, the Russian government is behind it. Anybody that would hack to try to destabilize an election, you can’t automatically assume that everything in all of these documents are even real,” Kaine said. \\nWhile Kaine was serious about the buzziest headlines, he also poked some fun at himself. He joked about his interruptions of Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence during the recent vice presidential debate. \\n“I have apparently watched too many episodes of The View , I mean, with the interrupts,” Kaine said. \\nWhen asked if it hurt to be called the loser of the debate, Kaine said, “Again, I wasn’t going in to win the debate. I was going in to try to win the election. That was my goal.” \\nFor the second part of his interview, Kaine was joined by his wife Anne Holton. The two described their dating days during which Kaine wrote poetry for Holton. \\nHolton was asked about the younger pictures of Kaine that some have described as proof that he was once a hottie. \\n“I actually think he’s hotter now than he was then, so,” Holton said. “But I don’t like to say that in front of him. I don’t want his head to get swollen.” \\nKaine followed up, joking, “She said that once and I said, honey, thanks for that compliment saying you’re hot. She said I didn’t say you’re hot. I said you’re hotter now than you were then. I thought you were kind of goofy back then.” \\nCopyright © 2016, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"Liberty U Students Break With Falwell Jr: We Want Nothing To Do With Trump Source: Talking Points Memo\\nStudents at the evangelical Liberty University are breaking with school president Jerry Falwell Jr. over his support of Donald Trump, issuing a statement Wednesday night saying we want nothing to do with him.\\nClaiming that Trump is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose, the statement from Liberty United Against Trump, which was obtained by The Washington Post , criticizes Falwell Jr. for tying the universitys name to a man who bragged about and is accused of sexually assaulting women.\\nAny faculty or staff member at Liberty would be terminated for such comments, and yet when Donald Trump makes them, President Falwell rushes eagerly to his defense  taking the name Liberty University with him, the statement reads.\\nIt is not enough to criticize these kinds of comments, the students continued. We must make clear to the world that while everyone is a sinner and everyone can be forgiven, a man who constantly and proudly speaks evil does not deserve our support for the nations highest office.\\n-snip-\\nRead more: http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/liberty-university-students-break-with-jerry-falwell-over-trump-support\\nRead the students full statement below:\\nIn the months since Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed him, Donald Trump has been inexorably associated with Liberty University. We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwells endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him.\\nA majority of Liberty students, faculty, and staff feel as we do. Donald Trump received a pitiful 90 votes from Liberty students in Virginias primary election, a colossal rejection of his campaign. Nevertheless, President Falwell eagerly uses his national platform to advocate for Donald Trump. While he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials.\\nAssociating any politician with Christianity is damaging to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But Donald Trump is not just any politician. He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.\\nA recently uncovered tape revealed his comments bragging about sexually assaulting women. Any faculty or staff member at Liberty would be terminated for such comments, and yet when Donald Trump makes them, President Falwell rushes eagerly to his defense  taking the name Liberty University with him. Were all sinners, Falwell told the media, as if sexual assault is a shoulder-shrugging issue rather than an atrocity which plagues college campuses across America, including our own.\\nIt is not enough to criticize these kinds of comments. We must make clear to the world that while everyone is a sinner and everyone can be forgiven, a man who constantly and proudly speaks evil does not deserve our support for the nations highest office.\\nJesus tells a story in the Bible about a man who tries to remove a speck of dust from his brothers eye, while he has a log stuck in his own. You hypocrite, Jesus says, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brothers eye.\\nWe Liberty students are often told to support Donald Trump because the other leading candidate is a bad option. Perhaps this is true. But the only candidate who is directly associated with Liberty University is Donald Trump.\\nBecause our president has led the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support.\\nWe are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. While our president Jerry Falwell Jr. tours the country championing the log in his eye, we want the world to know how many students oppose him. We dont want to champion Donald Trump; we want only to be champions for Christ.\",\n",

The last time I checked Article II of the Constitution, it stated, \\\"No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the age of 35 years, and been 14 years a resident within the United States.\\\" \\nThe \\\"unfit\\\" narrative put forward by the news media is particularly disgusting when considering its praise of Barack Obama, who had no experience whatsoever as a chief executive anywhere. \\nThe news media put forward a narrative which has no legs: say what you will about Donald J. Trump, but he has not been responsible for any of the problems in federal government over the past 30+ years, whereas Hillary Rodham Clinton has been at the epicenter of it all, whether in the cabinet of a failed president, guiding failed policy, or at the heart of scandals for which we, the taxpayers, have been on the receiving end. ×\",\n",

But Trump is a deeply imperfect messenger: his attacks on the Clintons’ treatment of women are being overshadowed by a flood of allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent. The New York Times and the Palm Beach Post reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them. Related posts:\",\n",

By Amber Phillips October 13 at 2:38 PM Follow byamberphillips \\nHere's a thought exercise for you for you: If a GOP congressional candidate has never met Donald Trump, how can Democrats air an attack ad of him shaking Trump's hand? \\nThe first response that comes to mind -- for me at least -- is: Photoshop. And that's exactly what House Democrats' campaign arm did when they superimposed Rep. David Jolly's (R-Fla.) head over an image of another white guy shaking Trump's hand. An attack ad released by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee targets Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), and is being criticized for featuring photoshopped images of Jolly standing next to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. (DCCC) \\n\\nBut is that even legal? Jolly, who is in a competitive reelection battle with former Gov. Charlie Crist (D), doesn't think so. As The Tampa Bay Times reports, he looked up at the TV while at a fundraiser Tuesday night, saw an image of him \\\"shaking hands\\\" with Trump, and threatened to sue the TV stations running it if they don't take it down. \\n\\\"Not only have I never met Donald Trump,\\\" Jolly told the Times' Charlie Frago . \\\"I don't own a red-and-white striped tie.\\\" \\nIt's true you can't just run a political ad claiming something happened that didn't. The ad couldn't say, like, \\\"Jolly says he'll vote for Trump,\\\" because Jolly has actually said he won't vote for Trump. \\nBut you can exaggerate something that might happen to prove a point, political ad experts tell me. \\nThe key is to make sure what you're dramatizing doesn't pass the believability test: Would a reasonable person actually think this is true? If so, media law says you've taken too much liberty with something. \\nIf a reasonable person can tell it's fake, you're probably good to go. And in general, the courts have given political ad makers wide latitude to dramatize things. \\nLet's take the Jolly example. Do you watch this and think he actually shook hands with Trump? \\nBelievability is in the eye of the beholder. But ad experts point out to me that the image of them \\\"meeting\\\" has the word \\\"Dramatization\\\" underneath it. \\nAnd the entire ad is framed as a \\\"What if\\\" scenario, asking viewers to \\\"imagine\\\" a Donald Trump presidency. If you're to follow the ad's logic, under that scenario, Jolly might be shaking hands with the president because he's a Republican and so is Trump. And here's what such a handshake would look like. \\nJolly's lawyers don't see it this way. The Tampa Bay Times' Frago reports Jolly's attorney wrote a letter to Tampa NBC affiliate WFLA demanding they stop running the ad, calling it misleading and \\\"patently false.\\\" \\nNo word on whether the TV station has dropped it. Jolly is one of House Republicans' most endangered incumbents in 2016 . He's in a seat redistricted to lean left, and he's burned bridges with the establishment in his party after he criticized it for its fundraising demands in a \\\"60 Minutes\\\" segment. Which means that while Democratic groups are pouring in more than a million to help Crist -- and run ads like the one in question -- Jolly can't count on the same firepower to fight back at an ad he hates. \\nAnd given what we know about media law, it's also not clear whether Jolly can effectively sue a TV station over it either. politics\",\n",

By Amber Phillips October 13 at 2:08 PM Follow byamberphillips The bridge in question, George Washington Bridge, in 2016. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \\nA judge just opened the door for New Jersey prosecutors to investigate whether to charge New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) with a crime in relation to Bridgegate. But it's not clear prosecutors would even go down that road. \\nStill, this is a newsworthy development for a governor who has long maintained he did not know anything about closing lanes of one of the world's busiest bridges for 5 days in 2013, apparently in an act of political retribution against a local mayor. So let's dig in. \\nOn Wednesday, a New Jersey judge decided to allow a complaint of misconduct filed by a local activist to go forward, which means the judge essentially handed the complaint over to New Jersey prosecutors to decide what to do with it. \\nChristie has, for years — and as recently as Tuesday — denied he knew anything about the lane closures that snarled the New York and New Jersey area on the first week children were back in school three years ago. \\n“The simple fact is the Governor had no knowledge of the lane realignments either before they happened or while they were happening,” Brian Murray, a spokesman for the governor, told NBC New York . “This matter has already been thoroughly investigated by three separate independent investigations.” \\nBut even a hint of possibly being charged with criminal wrongdoing is not good news for Christie. Whatever political ambitions he may have had after his failed presidential run and his term as governor ends in 2017 may have already been crushed thanks to a really bad 2016 . Joining the Donald Trump administration has been on the table — he's chairman of Trump's transition team right now — but the Republican nominee would first have to win. \\nNow, there's at least the possibility — however remote — that Christie could be indicted for the scandal that has come to define him. And in an absolute worst, worst-case scenario, he could face jail time. \\nHere's what you need to know about the latest Bridgegate developments. \\nWhere are we now in Bridgegate fallout? \\nSome of Christie's former allies have long said Christie knew about the lane closures. Two of his top former aides are on trial right now related to it. Another pleaded guilty in relation to closing the lanes. Their lawyers argue Christie knew about the closures and made them scapegoats to protect his 2016 presidential ambitions. \\nBut September, as the New York Times' Kate Zernike reported , was the first time we heard prosecution say they also think Christie knew: \\nThe prosecutor, speaking for the United States attorney’s office, said that two of the alleged co-conspirators in the case, David Wildstein and Bill Baroni, had “bragged” to the governor about the lane closings at a memorial service for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, on the third day of the closings, and that they had been done to “mess” with Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, a Democrat, because he had declined entreaties to endorse the governor’s reelection. \\nIf Christie knew, why wasn't he charged? \\nThe answer isn't really clear; Zernike reported that merely knowing is not a crime. \\nOther investigations have cleared him. In 2014, lawyers — working for Christie — completed a review and came to the conclusion Christie wasn't involved. \\nThen, there's the question of how to even charge him. The Associated Press reports Bridgegate is a difficult case to prosecute because there was no obvious tit-for-tat. The bridges were closed after Christie had won the election in question, where the Fort Lee mayor, a Democrat, refused to endorse him. And those allegedly involved didn't get any money, cars or favors for doing it. \\nWhat happened in the trial of Christie aides? \\nIt's still going on. (Bridgegate is a complicated nest of political personalities and ambitions, he-said, she-said finger-pointing and government bureaucracy. It takes a while to unravel. Here's a refresher .) \\nBut the developments aren't good news for Christie. On Tuesday, a lawyer for Christie's former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, said Kelly told Christie about the lane closures before they happened and the week they were happening. Kelly is the second former aide to say Christie was informed about the closures. \\nRegarding that trial, Christie has said if he were served with a subpoena, he would testify. That hasn't happened yet. \\nWhat happens next for Christie? \\nIt depends. Could be nothing, or he could be charged with a crime, likely misusing his public office. The Bergen County Prosecutor's office now faces whether there is enough evidence to put the case before a grand jury, who in turn would decide whether to indict Christie. \\nOr that could not happen at all. Prosecutors' offices have wide discretion on whether to pursue a case, said James Cohen, a criminal law expert with Fordham Law School. “The prosecutor is under no obligation to do anything at all, nor is the prosecutor barred in any way from digging up the kitchen sink and throwing it at Christie.” \\nPolitics is also likely to play a role, Cohen said. Charging a sitting governor with a crime is a lot of work and will require prosecutors to meet a high legal standard of proof. Prosecutors will be looking at whether the evidence on Christie rises to that occasion. But they're also likely to factor in the ongoing trial of Christie's two aides. \\nIf prosecutors decide to pursue a misconduct charge, and if a grand jury decides there's enough evidence, it could go to trial. And — we're firmly in hypothetical land here — IF Christie is found guilty related to misusing his public office to commit a crime (what crime, we're not sure yet since no one's charged him with one), he could face jail time. New Jersey's misconduct law says a public servant who commits a crime in office could face up to 10 years in jail. \\nBut that's a lot of ifs to get to jail time. Right now all we know is the door is at least opened for prosecutors to charge Christie with a crime related to Bridgegate. politics\",\n",

EFE/EPA/ANDREW GOMBERT Menéame \\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday accused The New York Times and People magazine, which have both published statements of alleged victims of sexual abuse by the magnate, of fabricating complaints against him. \\nOn his Twitter account, Trump said that the Times story is \\\"phony\\\" and a \\\"total fabrication,\\\" adding that it is \\\"written by same people as last discredited story on women.\\\" \\nThe daily published the claims of two women, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks, who said that they had been groped by Trump some three decades ago and in 2005, respectively. \\nLeeds, now 74, told the daily that the magnate was like an \\\"octopus\\\" when they were seated beside each other on a first class flight and he grabbed her breasts and tried to place his hand under her skirt. \\nCrooks said that in 2005, when she was 22 and working in the Trump Tower in New York, she ran into the mogul in one of the building's elevators and that he, who had never met her before, kissed her on the mouth. \\nIn another tweet, Trump also responded on Wednesday to the statement of a People magazine reporter who said that, during a 2005 interview with the billionaire, he had forced himself on her. \\n\\\"Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the 'incident' in her story. Because it did not happen!\\\" wrote Trump on Twitter. \\nAccording to the statement of journalist Natasha Stoynoff published in People, during the interview with Trump and his wife Melania, the magnate took the reporter into a hotel room at his property in Palm Beach, Florida, where he forcefully embraced her and kissed her without her consent. \\nStoynoff wrote that she decided not to mention the assault in her People story because \\\"I was ashamed and blamed myself for his transgression ... (and) I doubted my recollection and my reaction. I was afraid that a famous, powerful, wealthy man could and would discredit and destroy me, especially if I got his coveted PEOPLE feature killed.\\\" \\nTrump's attorneys at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman, asked the Times to retract the story and apologize or face legal action, the magnate's campaign said Wednesday, although the paper said it stood by the story. \\nThe mogul has found himself in a firestorm of criticism since last Friday when a 2005 videotape was released on which he can be heard making lewd and sexist comments about women.\",\n",

Kamie Crawford—who's currently a television host—hit Twitter to recount her experience with Trump's alleged racism, saying she was warned that he doesn't like a certain \\\"type\\\" of black women. The most Trump tea I'll spill for the day is this... when I was 17, I met Mr. Trump for the first time as Miss Teen USA. As the first WOC... \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 12, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below To win the title in almost a decade - I was forewarned prior to meeting him that, \\\"Mr. Trump doesn't like black people. So don't take it...\\\" \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 12, 2016 Most Popular \\\"...the wrong way if he isn't extremely welcoming towards you. If he is, then u just must be the \\\"type\\\" of black he likes.\\\" \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 12, 2016 She then witnessed his behavior towards a fellow black contestant. Now again... I'm 17. Raised in the suburbs of Potomac, MD. Only experienced racism personally ONCE and it was outside of my hometown. SO... \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 12, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Needless to say, I was totally caught off guard&super nervous bc this is supposed to be my boss I'm meeting - &he might not like me ALREADY? \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 12, 2016 Sure enough after I was warned about him, I saw him in action&witnessed him completely snub a black contestant at Miss Universe rehearsals.. \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 12, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below While she was practicing on stage. Literally turned his back to the stage and made a face like he was going to vomit at the sight of her. \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 12, 2016 Getty Crawford says she was hesitant to meet Trump after witnessing his behavior, but he ended up taking a liking to her. Luckily for me - I was the \\\"type\\\" of black he liked. He toted me around his buddies who were all there gawking at the Miss Universe girls.. \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 13, 2016 Most Popular Bragged about how \\\"beautiful\\\" and \\\"well spoken\\\" I was. \\\"She's so smart, look how smart she is\\\" he kept saying.

(I was maybe 2 months into my reign at the time) \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 13, 2016 Now, Crawford realizes Trump's alleged behavior was nothing to be over the moon about. But in hindsight, there was nothing to be excited about. This man is running for president of a country with ALL \\\"types\\\" of black. \\n— Kamie Crawford (@TheRealKamie) October 13, 2016 &honey, if u ain't his \\\"type\\\" Idk what to tell u.

(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) ##time## | ##duration## \\nLAS VEGAS (AP) - Donald Trump's campaign is denying reports that the Republican presidential nominee kissed and groped women without their permission. Wednesday, The New York Times and the Palm Beach Post reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them. And a reporter for People Magazine wrote a detailed first-person account of being attacked by Trump while interviewing the businessman and his wife, Melania. \\nTrump's campaign is now openly signaling it will spend the election's final month re-litigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as his wife and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's unverified role in intimidating the women who were involved. But Trump is a deeply imperfect messenger: his attacks on the Clintons' treatment of women are being overshadowed by a flood of allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent. \\nThe New York Times and the Palm Beach Post reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them.

By Chris Cillizza October 13 at 2:06 PM Follow @thefix At an Oct. 13 Hillary Clinton campaign event, first lady Michelle Obama grew emotional while talking about allegations of sexual assault against Republican nominee Donald Trump. (Youtube/Hillary Clinton) \\nIt's been six days since a hot-mic tape in which Donald Trump makes a series of lewd and sexually suggestive comments about women went public. But until first lady Michelle Obama stepped on the podium at a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton on Thursday in New Hampshire, no public figure has so effectively encapsulated how this moment has made many American women feel. \\nAn at-times emotional Obama admitted that she “couldn't stop thinking about” the comments made by Trump and had to address them in her speech.\\\" It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn’t have predicted,” she added. Her speech reflected just how much Trump's remarks affected her. \\n“This is not normal,” Obama said at one point. “This is not politics as usual.” At another she insisted that “strong men don't need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful.” \\nWhat Obama did in the speech is put a face and a name — and a very high-profile one at that — to Trump's words on that bus in 2005. She didn't say “words hurt” or “words have impact,” but that was quite clearly the message she was sending. Even Michelle Obama, first lady of the United States, knows what it is like to be ogled, to be treated as an object by men. \\nThat's powerful stuff. (If you have not seen or heard her speech, you should check it out here .) \\nObama's speech will go down as one of the most important of this political cycle, a moment in which she crystallized the feelings of many women in the wake of the Trump tape. She was outraged, yes, but also hurt — for herself and for women more broadly. And she expressed all of those emotions in ways you rarely see any politician (or private citizen do) — particularly one as well known as Obama. \\nIt seemed to me — as I watched it live — that she was putting a sort of exclamation point on the past five days, days that have been filled with lewd talk from Trump and a series of allegations by women who say the Republican presidential nominee groped them in the past 30 years. “Enough,” she was saying. This is bad for women, yes. But it's also bad for all of us. \\nThis speech, along with her address at the Democratic National Convention , are two of the best speeches — maybe the two best — given by any public figure this year. Both, yes, were made by a partisan in support of a partisan candidate for president. But neither felt like the typical party pap. In that speech in July and again Thursday, Obama was able to tap into something far deeper than “Democrat” or “Republican.” She was, in both instances, speaking to a shared humanity that we could all use more of no matter our political inclinations.

In the circa 1992 clip shot at Trump Tower, 46-year-old Trump addresses the child, asking \\\"You going up the escalator?\\\" and then quips, \\\"I'm going to be dating her in ten years, can you believe it?\\\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The clip comes hot off the heels of five women accusing Trump of touching them inappropriately—including a People Magazine reporter who alleges Trump forcibly kissed her during a photoshoot with then-pregnant Melania Trump. Trump's thoughts on the claims (specifically those laid out in the New York Times ) are as follows: The phoney story in the failing @nytimes is a TOTAL FABRICATION.

Maxwell Tani/Business Insider \\nMichelle Obama on Thursday unleashed on Donald Trump over the various sexual-assault controversies looming over his campaign. \\nAt a campaign event in New Hampshire, the first lady delivered an lengthy, emotional speech condemning Trump's lewd 2005 statements boasting about grabbing and kissing women without their permission. \\nObama characterized Trump's comments that he could \\\"grab women \\\"by the p---y\\\" as \\\"so shocking, and so demeaning, that I simply will not repeat anything here today.\\\" \\n\\\"I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted,\\\" Obama said. \\nShe added: \\\"So while I'd love nothing more than to pretend that this isn't happening, and to come out here and give my normal campaign speech, it'd be dishonest and disingenuous for me to just move on the to the next thing like it's a bad dream.\\\" \\nThe first lady said the comments, as well as new allegations of sexual misconduct from several different women against Trump, amounted to \\\"sexually predatory behavior.\\\" \\nObama used examples of harassment in the workplace, in school, and in everyday interactions to illustrate what she perceived as the danger of Trump's candidacy. \\n\\\"The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, belief that you can do anything you want to a woman,\\\" Obama said. \\\"It is cruel. It is frightening. And the truth is it hurts. It's like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you're walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body. Or like that guy at work who stands a little too close, stares a little too long.\\\" \\nShe also attempted to reach out to men and members of other political parties, suggesting that many men were \\\"sickened\\\" by Trump's dismissal of his comments as \\\"locker room talk.\\\" \\n\\\"This is disgraceful. It's intolerable. It doesn't matter what party you belong to — Democrat, Republican, Independent, no woman deserves to be treated this way. No woman deserves that kind of abuse.\\\" \\nShe added: \\\"To dismiss this as innocent locker room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere. The men that you and I know don't treat women this way.\\\" \\nObama has made empowering women and girls a major part of her advocacy as first lady. She founded an official summit on women's issues earlier this year and established the \\\"Let Girls Learn\\\" initiative dedicated to increasing education for women across the globe.\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \\nTHE ISSUE: Voters are disgusted with the way political races are paid for — disproportionately by big-money donors, including those who stand to gain or lose from government decisions. The rules even allow donors to hide their identities by giving to politically active nonprofit groups that don't file detailed public paperwork about their finances. \\nThe system leaves everyday Americans fearing their voices are being drowned out by these moneyed interests. \\nHere's one example of how that can happen: Hillary Clinton headlined more closed-door fundraisers in August than there were days of the month. The spree left her with a record amount of money, but at the expense of spending time with voters. \\nTo be sure, donors are necessary; they pay the ever-increasing tab for campaigns. So far, donors have pumped more than $1.7 billion into the presidential race, according to an Associated Press tally of election and advertising records. \\nOutside groups that face no contribution limits account for about one-third of that total. Money has been pouring into those groups ever since the 2010 Supreme Court decision in a case known as Citizens United. That ruling and subsequent court decisions and regulatory changes made it clear to wealthy donors that they can give as much as they'd like, so long as the candidates themselves aren't controlling how that money gets spent. \\nIt's enough to make some candidates say they want to throw the whole system out and start fresh. \\n--- \\nWHERE THEY STAND \\nBoth presidential candidates talk a good game when it comes to money in politics, but both fail to back their words with action. \\nClinton, a Democrat, says she'd like to get \\\"unaccountable money out of politics.\\\" She has vowed to \\\"overturn\\\" Citizens United — something she cannot directly do as president — either by nominating Supreme Court justices who would rule differently or proposing a constitutional amendment to undo it. It's extremely difficult to amend the founding document. She also has called upon Congress to require outside groups to disclose \\\"significant\\\" political spending. That's a murky request unlikely to go anywhere in a divided Congress. \\nRepublican Donald Trump has denounced \\\"corrupt\\\" outside groups and disparaged his rivals as \\\"puppets\\\" of big donors. Yet he has not proposed any policies that would change the campaign finance system. \\nMeanwhile, Clinton and Trump have both sought out major donors in this costly presidential race. Each flouts the $2,700-per-donor contribution limit by partnering with their respective parties, which can accept far more money than the candidates can on their own. And both benefit from multimillion-dollar super PACs and their even more controversial cousins, groups that don't disclose their donors at all. \\n--- \\nWHY IT MATTERS \\nConcern about money in politics has been on vivid display throughout the 2016 race. \\nIn the primaries, Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders used unconventional methods to highlight their stated aversion to the influence of wealthy donors. Sanders, a Vermont senator, fueled his upstart bid with small contributions made mostly online by millions of supporters. It was a crowd-sourcing antidote to big money in politics. \\nTrump, a businessman who says he has billions of dollars at his disposal, was able to largely eschew donors during the GOP primary by writing his own checks. In all, he has put more than $50 million into his presidential bid. In the general election, he's been stingier with his own money. He's better than Clinton at raising \\\"Sanders-style\\\" money, but he also now pursues the same major donors he once dismissed. \\nNegative views on money in politics transcend party lines. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey last year found that nearly nine in 10 respondents thought that limiting outside spending would curb the influence of money in politics at least somewhat, and more than half see outside groups such as super PACs as an unacceptable way to finance politics. \\nAction remains elusive, even though both candidates claim they want things to change. \\n--- \\nThis story is part of AP's \\\"Why It Matters\\\" series, which is examining three dozen issues at stake in the presidential election between now and Election Day. You can find them at: http://apne.ws/2bBG85a \\n--- \\nKeep track on how much Clinton and Trump are spending on television advertising, and where they're spending it, via AP's interactive ad tracker. http://elections.ap.org/content/ad-spending \\nEDITOR'S NOTE - One in an AP series examining issues at stake in the presidential election and how they affect people Related content\",\n",

The first attack was carried out in support of groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, seeking independence from Belgrade, while the second was in support of similar forces in Kosovo.\\n\\\"The bombing of Serbs, who were our allies in both world wars, was a big mistake, Trump told Serbian weekly magazine Nedeljnik. Serbians are very good people.

FILE - In this Sept. 13, 2016, file photo, former President Bill Clinton pauses for a selfie with a supporter at a coffee shop while campaigning for his wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Los Angele...   \\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on the U.S. presidential race (all times EDT): \\n2:15 p.m. \\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is not taking questions from a friendly audience of Wisconsin business leaders even though his office originally said he would. \\nRyan on Thursday gave a speech at the Waukesha County Business Alliance. He got a standing ovation as he entered, but left immediately after his remarks. His office had said in the original notice that he would take 30 minutes of questions. Ryan's campaign spokesman Zack Roday says he had to leave due to a tight schedule. \\nRyan did not refer to Donald Trump by name during the speech, but bemoaned the lack of focus on issues Republicans want to talk about. He says, \\\"Guess what? We are actually running on ideas in this election.\\\" \\nRyan has endorsed Trump, but said last week he wouldn't campaign for him. \\n___ \\n2:05 p.m. \\nDonald Trump is saying the attacks on him are \\\"a conspiracy against the American people\\\" by the political and media establishment. \\nTrump, speaking Thursday in Florida after being rocked by sexual assault allegations, said the press \\\"will seek to destroy your career and your family.\\\" \\nThe Republican nominee said: \\\"They will seek to destroy everything about you including your reputation.\\\" \\nBut he said that he would \\\"take the slings and arrows\\\" in order to protect his supporters and vowed that America would have a \\\"new Independence Day\\\" on Election Day. \\nTrump denied the allegations made by several women that he touched and kissed them without their consent. \\n___ \\n1:55 p.m. \\nThe New York Times is responding to Donald Trump's lawsuit threat by saying it welcomes the challenge. \\nThe response came from David E. McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel for the New York Times Company. He said in a letter Thursday that the public has a right to hear from women who say the Republican presidential nominee sexually assaulted them. \\nThe Times published a story Wednesday quoting two women who said Trump had touched or kissed them without their consent. Trump denies the allegations. \\nTrump has threatened to sue the newspaper. McCraw wrote to a lawyer for Trump that if Trump believes the law protects him from critics, \\\"we welcome an opportunity to have a court set him straight.\\\" \\n___ \\n1:45 p.m. \\nThe questions about Donald Trump are clearly starting to get old for U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. \\nThe Republican is in a tight re-election campaign with Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander. Blunt supports Trump, but has distanced himself from the Republican presidential candidate. \\nAsked after a campaign appearance in suburban St. Louis on Thursday about new allegations by women accusing Trump of inappropriate behavior, Blunt said the issue \\\"is not what we ought to be talking about.\\\" \\nAsked if he is reconsidering his support, Blunt said the question has been \\\"asked and answered like 10 times in the last week, and the answer's still the same.\\\" \\nBlunt said he wants a president who can change the Affordable Care Act, reduce regulation, and improve foreign policy. \\n___ \\n1:40 p.m. \\nRocked by sexual assault allegations, Donald Trump is saying that that his campaign is \\\"an existential threat\\\" to the political establishment. \\nTrump made his comments at a rally Thursday in West Palm Beach, Florida. It was his first appearance since several women stepped forward to say they had been groped and received unwanted advances from Trump. \\nThe Republican nominee said \\\"the political establishment'\\\" is trying to stop us and said that \\\"for the media, nothing is out of bounds.\\\" \\n__ \\n1:30 p.m. \\nDonald Trump is denying allegations of sexual assault and calls them \\\"coordinated, vicious attack\\\" from the media and Hillary Clinton campaign. \\nTrump said Thursday at a rally in Florida that he has evidence to disprove allegations of sexual assault and will release it at the \\\"appropriate time.\\\" \\nSeveral women have come forward in a series of reports claiming that Trump groped or kissed them without their consent and made unwanted advances. \\nTrump said the claims \\\"are totally and absolutely false.\\\" He called them \\\"pure fiction and outright lies.\\\" \\n___ \\n1:20 p.m. \\nDonald Trump has dodged reporter's question as to whether he has ever touched or kissed a woman without her consent. \\nTrump met with local business leaders Thursday before a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida. The rally comes amid a series of reports about women who claim Trump had groped them and made other unwanted sexual advances. \\nTrump did not answer the question as the roundtable attendees booed. \\nTrump then turned to the room and declared \\\"what a sleazebag.\\\" \\n___ \\n1:09 p.m. \\nMichelle Obama said she \\\"was shaken to the core\\\" by comments that GOP Republican nominee Donald Trump made in which he is heard on a 2005 tape bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. \\nSpeaking at campaign rally in New Hampshire for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama called the comments \\\"shocking and demeaning. She also dismissed suggestion that they were simply \\\"locker room talk,\\\" saying they were affront to all women and parents. \\nThe GOP nominee has lost support in New Hampshire following the release of a 2005 video in which Trump is heard bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said over the weekend that she no longer plans to vote for him. \\n___ \\n12:55 p.m. \\nFirst lady Michelle Obama says Donald Trump's crude sexual comments about women should not be seen as \\\"politics as usual.\\\" \\nMrs. Obama was speaking at a Hillary Clinton rally in New Hampshire. She called the Republican presidential nominee's language disgraceful and intolerable. \\nShe said that it should outrage all, regardless of political affiliation. She said he was bragging about sexually assaulting women. \\nMrs. Obama was referring to a 2005 video in which Trump is heard bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. He later dismissed his language as \\\"locker room talk.\\\" \\n___ \\n12:10 p.m. \\nThere's unprecedented uncertainty about how conservative Utah will vote in the November election. \\nThat's because the usual cohesion of voters in the Republican stronghold has been blown up by Donald Trump's crudeness and volatility. \\nUtah is a must-win state for Trump, and he may end up squeaking out a victory. But the state's widespread aversion to the brash billionaire has soared following the release of a recording of Trump degrading women. \\nAn increasing number of Utah's mostly Mormon voters are considering going with third-party candidates Evan McMullin and Gary Johnson. \\nIt could mean an improbable Utah victory for Democrat Hillary Clinton if she captures just one-third of the state's votes. That's a level achieved several times in past three decades by Democratic candidates. \\n___ \\n11:50 a.m. \\nTim Kaine says Hillary Clinton's marriage is \\\"not an issue for the voters,\\\" despite Donald Trump's efforts to highlight Bill Clinton's misconduct. \\nThe Democratic vice presidential nominee is reacting to the campaign's new focus on both candidates' treatment of women. He was appearing Thursday on ABC's \\\"The View.\\\" Trump has been talking about Bill Clinton's affairs and making unproven charges of sexual assault. \\nKaine said the latest allegations from several women who said Trump touched or kissed them without permission are \\\"shocking.\\\" \\nKaine is also playing down the latest batch of hacked emails of Clinton campaign staffers. \\nHe says you \\\"can't automatically assume\\\" the hacked emails are real. \\nIt's impossible to authenticate each hacked email published by Wikileaks, but Democrats have not pointed to specific cases in which emails were altered. \\n____ \\n9:40 a.m. \\nDonald Trump is trying to discredit new allegations of groping and sexual assault. \\nThe Republican nominee says on Twitter that a New York Times story on two women who allege he groped them years ago is \\\"phony\\\" and a \\\"total fabrication.\\\" \\nTrump is also going after a People Magazine writer who alleges Trump pinned her against a wall and kissed her without consent in 2005 as she was interviewing him for a wedding anniversary story. \\nHe tweeted: \\\"Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the \\\"incident\\\" in her story. Because it did not happen! \\nThe writer says she didn't publicize the incident at the time because she was ashamed, afraid of the repercussions and blamed herself for what she says happened. \\n___ \\n8:05 a.m. \\nThe soap opera actress in the video that has rocked the presidential campaign says Donald Trump's comments were offensive. \\nBut actress Arianne Zucker says she wasn't shocked by it, given \\\"that type of personality.\\\" She says that's \\\"probably why it doesn't mean a lot to me.\\\" \\nZucker spoke in an interview broadcast Thursday on NBC's \\\"Today.\\\" \\nZucker is the actress who meets Trump and TV personality Billy Bush on a soap opera set in the 2005 video. In the video, Trump boasts of using his fame to kiss and grab women. Trump, before greeting Zucker, tells Bush he needs to use Tic Tacs in case he starts kissing her. \\nTrump has said he regrets the remarks, which he describes as \\\"locker room\\\" banter. Zucker describes that as \\\"an interesting apology.\\\" \\n___ \\n3:10 a.m. \\nAmerica's campaign for president is quickly devolving into an ugly fight over who has treated women worse: Donald Trump, whose White House bid is floundering, or Bill Clinton, who isn't on the ballot. \\nTrump's campaign is now openly signaling it will spend the election's final month re-litigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as his wife and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's unverified role in intimidating the women who were involved. But Trump is a deeply imperfect messenger: his attacks on the Clintons' treatment of women are being overshadowed by a flood of allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent. \\nThe New York Times and the Palm Beach Post reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them.  \",\n",

Show Caption Previous Next \\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Rocked by allegations of sexual assault, Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at his female accusers as \\\"horrible, horrible liars\\\" as the deeply divisive presidential campaign sank further into charges and countercharges of predatory treatment of women. \\nThe Republican businessman devoted much of a Florida speech to defending himself against multiple reports of inappropriate sexual behavior — accusations that he blamed on Hillary Clinton's campaign and the news media. \\n\\\"These vicious claims about me, of inappropriate conduct with women, are totally and absolutely false. And the Clintons know it,\\\" Trump declared. His accusers, he said, \\\"are horrible people. They're horrible, horrible liars.\\\" \\nThe comments came minutes after he called a reporter \\\"a sleazebag\\\" for asking whether Trump had ever touched or groped a woman without her consent. \\n#Trump on @people writer: \\\"Look at her I don't think so.\\\" Is he saying he wouldn't have touched her because she's ugly? #vote2016 pic.twitter.com/zBVH6LBbUt — Gary Detman (@GaryDetmanNews) October 13, 2016 \\n\\nFirst lady Michelle Obama, meanwhile, offered an emotional counterargument in battleground New Hampshire, warning that Trump's behavior sends a dangerous message to the nation's children. \\n\\\"The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman, it is cruel, it is frightening, and the truth is it hurts,\\\" Obama said. She added, \\\"We can't expose our children to this any longer, not for another minute, let alone for four years.\\\" \\nThe New York Times and the Palm Beach Post on Wednesday reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them. Separately, a People Magazine reporter wrote a detailed first-person account of being attacked by Trump while interviewing the businessman and his wife, Melania Trump. \\nTrump said the claims \\\"are all fabricated.\\\" \\n\\\"They're pure fiction, and they're outright lies. These events never happened,\\\" he said at the West Palm Beach rally. \\nHe added, \\\"I will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies.\\\" \\n— Sydney Ember (@melbournecoal) October 13, 2016 \\n\\nAt the same time, Trump's flailing campaign signaled it would spend the election's final month relitigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as what Trump says is Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's role in intimidating the women who were involved. \\nThe developments come less than a week after the publication of a 2005 recording in which the Republican nominee boasted of using his fame to kiss and grab women without their consent. \\nIn an interview broadcast Thursday, the soap opera actress in the video said Trump's comments were offensive. But actress Arianne Zucker, on NBC's \\\"Today,\\\" said she wasn't shocked, given \\\"that type of personality.\\\" \\nThe revelation of the video last Friday prompted many Republicans to withdraw their support for Trump — with some calling for him to drop out of the race — though a handful have since switched back to supporting him. \\nClinton adviser Jennifer Palmieri said the latest revelations match \\\"everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women.\\\" \\nTaken together, the stories about Trump and his retorts about Bill Clinton have plunged an already rancorous campaign to new lows. The real estate mogul has also aggressively charged that Hillary Clinton not only needs to be defeated in November but also imprisoned: \\\"Honestly, she should be locked up,\\\" he said Thursday. \\nAnd his campaign is facing questions about ties to Russian interests accused of hacking Democratic groups, as well as the hacking of a top Clinton adviser's emails. \\nFor Trump, the cumulative effect appears to be a tumble in the battleground states he needs to win in November. What was already a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory is virtually indiscernible for Trump unless there's a significant shake-up in the race between now and Nov. 8 \\nRather than trying to make up ground by shifting attention back to issues like trade that have energized Trump backers and could appeal to new voters, the Republican campaign appears to be moving swiftly to make Bill Clinton's past a centerpiece of its campaign. \\nBuilding on Trump's decision to bring three Bill Clinton accusers to last week's presidential debate, the Republican nominee is expected to have the women appear with him on stage at rallies and do television interviews, according to a person briefed on the plan but not authorized to discuss it publicly. They were not on stage in West Palm Beach. \\nThe Trump campaign's hope is to showcase the decades-old accusations to young voters, particularly women, who may not have been old enough to remember the controversies that dogged the Clintons in the 1990s. If the campaign can't get them to vote for Trump, the hope is that they will stay home and depress turnout, which would likely hurt Democrats. \\nBut it's unclear whether Trump's strategy is even aimed at winning the election at this point. \\nIncreasingly, Trump's campaign feels like an opportunity for longtime Clinton opponents to air decades worth of grievances about the Democratic power couple on the biggest stage in American politics. \\nTrump confidant and informal adviser Roger Stone has long encouraged Trump to make Bill Clinton's alleged assaults and the way his wife treated his accusers a centerpiece of the campaign. Steve Bannon, the campaign's chief executive, ran Breitbart News, a conservative website that eagerly promotes conspiracy theories about the Clintons. \\nHillary Clinton, who is on pace to become America's first female president if her lead holds, has tried to stay above the fray. She has yet to respond directly to Trump's decision to resurrect accusations about her husband. \\nBack in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama said, \\\"Enough is enough.\\\" \\n\\\"This has got to stop right now. Because consider this: If all of this is painful to us as grown women, what do you think this is doing to our children?\\\" \\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "      \"text\": \"WASHINGTON (AP) -   \\n2:15 p.m. \\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is not taking questions from a friendly audience of Wisconsin business leaders even though his office originally said he would. \\nRyan on Thursday gave a speech at the Waukesha County Business Alliance. He got a standing ovation as he entered, but left immediately after his remarks. His office had said in the original notice that he would take 30 minutes of questions. Ryan's campaign spokesman Zack Roday says he had to leave due to a tight schedule. \\nRyan did not refer to Donald Trump by name during the speech, but bemoaned the lack of focus on issues Republicans want to talk about. He says, \\\"Guess what? We are actually running on ideas in this election.\\\" \\nRyan has endorsed Trump, but said last week he wouldn't campaign for him. \\n___ \\n2:05 p.m. \\nDonald Trump is saying the attacks on him are \\\"a conspiracy against the American people\\\" by the political and media establishment. \\nTrump, speaking Thursday in Florida after being rocked by sexual assault allegations, said the press \\\"will seek to destroy your career and your family.\\\" \\nThe Republican nominee said: \\\"They will seek to destroy everything about you including your reputation.\\\" \\nBut he said that he would \\\"take the slings and arrows\\\" in order to protect his supporters and vowed that America would have a \\\"new Independence Day\\\" on Election Day. \\nTrump denied the allegations made by several women that he touched and kissed them without their consent. \\n___ \\n1:55 p.m. \\nThe New York Times is responding to Donald Trump's lawsuit threat by saying it welcomes the challenge. \\nThe response came from David E. McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel for the New York Times Company. He said in a letter Thursday that the public has a right to hear from women who say the Republican presidential nominee sexually assaulted them. \\nThe Times published a story Wednesday quoting two women who said Trump had touched or kissed them without their consent. Trump denies the allegations. \\nTrump has threatened to sue the newspaper. McCraw wrote to a lawyer for Trump that if Trump believes the law protects him from critics, \\\"we welcome an opportunity to have a court set him straight.\\\" \\n___ \\n1:45 p.m. \\nThe questions about Donald Trump are clearly starting to get old for U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. \\nThe Republican is in a tight re-election campaign with Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander. Blunt supports Trump, but has distanced himself from the Republican presidential candidate. \\nAsked after a campaign appearance in suburban St. Louis on Thursday about new allegations by women accusing Trump of inappropriate behavior, Blunt said the issue \\\"is not what we ought to be talking about.\\\" \\nAsked if he is reconsidering his support, Blunt said the question has been \\\"asked and answered like 10 times in the last week, and the answer's still the same.\\\" \\nBlunt said he wants a president who can change the Affordable Care Act, reduce regulation, and improve foreign policy. \\n___ \\n1:40 p.m. \\nRocked by sexual assault allegations, Donald Trump is saying that that his campaign is \\\"an existential threat\\\" to the political establishment. \\nTrump made his comments at a rally Thursday in West Palm Beach, Florida. It was his first appearance since several women stepped forward to say they had been groped and received unwanted advances from Trump. \\nThe Republican nominee said \\\"the political establishment'\\\" is trying to stop us and said that \\\"for the media, nothing is out of bounds.\\\" \\n__ \\n1:30 p.m. \\nDonald Trump is denying allegations of sexual assault and calls them \\\"coordinated, vicious attack\\\" from the media and Hillary Clinton campaign. \\nTrump said Thursday at a rally in Florida that he has evidence to disprove allegations of sexual assault and will release it at the \\\"appropriate time.\\\" \\nSeveral women have come forward in a series of reports claiming that Trump groped or kissed them without their consent and made unwanted advances. \\nTrump said the claims \\\"are totally and absolutely false.\\\" He called them \\\"pure fiction and outright lies.\\\" \\n___ \\n1:20 p.m. \\nDonald Trump has dodged reporter's question as to whether he has ever touched or kissed a woman without her consent. \\nTrump met with local business leaders Thursday before a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida. The rally comes amid a series of reports about women who claim Trump had groped them and made other unwanted sexual advances. \\nTrump did not answer the question as the roundtable attendees booed. \\nTrump then turned to the room and declared \\\"what a sleazebag.\\\" \\n___ \\n1:09 p.m. \\nMichelle Obama said she \\\"was shaken to the core\\\"   how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. \\nSpeaking at campaign rally in New Hampshire for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama called the comments \\\"shocking and demeaning. She also dismissed suggestion that they were simply \\\"locker room talk,\\\" saying they were affront to all women and parents. \\nThe GOP nominee has lost support in New Hampshire following the release of a 2005 video in which Trump is heard bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said over the weekend that she no longer plans to vote for him. \\n___ \\n12:55 p.m. \\nFirst lady Michelle Obama says Donald Trump's crude sexual comments about women should not be seen as \\\"politics as usual.\\\" \\nMrs. Obama was speaking at a Hillary Clinton rally in New Hampshire. She called the Republican presidential nominee's language disgraceful and intolerable. \\nShe said that it should outrage all, regardless of political affiliation. She said he was bragging about sexually assaulting women. \\nMrs. Obama was referring to a 2005 video in which Trump is heard bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. He later dismissed his language as \\\"locker room talk.\\\" \\n___ \\n12:10 p.m. \\nThere's unprecedented uncertainty about how conservative Utah will vote in the November election. \\nThat's because the usual cohesion of voters in the Republican stronghold has been blown up by Donald Trump's crudeness and volatility. \\nUtah is a must-win state for Trump, and he may end up squeaking out a victory. But the state's widespread aversion to the brash billionaire has soared following the release of a recording of Trump degrading women. \\nAn increasing number of Utah's mostly Mormon voters are considering going with third-party candidates Evan McMullin and Gary Johnson. \\nIt could mean an improbable Utah victory for Democrat Hillary Clinton if she captures just one-third of the state's votes. That's a level achieved several times in past three decades by Democratic candidates. \\n___ \\n11:50 a.m. \\nTim Kaine says Hillary Clinton's marriage is \\\"not an issue for the voters,\\\" despite Donald Trump's efforts to highlight Bill Clinton's misconduct. \\nThe Democratic vice presidential nominee is reacting to the campaign's new focus on both candidates' treatment of women. He was appearing Thursday on ABC's \\\"The View.\\\" Trump has been talking about Bill Clinton's affairs and making unproven charges of sexual assault. \\nKaine said the latest allegations from several women who said Trump touched or kissed them without permission are \\\"shocking.\\\" \\nKaine is also playing down the latest batch of hacked emails of Clinton campaign staffers. \\nHe says you \\\"can't automatically assume\\\" the hacked emails are real. \\nIt's impossible to authenticate each hacked email published by Wikileaks, but Democrats have not pointed to specific cases in which emails were altered. \\n____ \\n9:40 a.m. \\nDonald Trump is trying to discredit new allegations of groping and sexual assault. \\nThe Republican nominee says on Twitter that a New York Times story on two women who allege he groped them years ago is \\\"phony\\\" and a \\\"total fabrication.\\\" \\nTrump is also going after a People Magazine writer who alleges Trump pinned her against a wall and kissed her without consent in 2005 as she was interviewing him for a wedding anniversary story. \\nHe tweeted: \\\"Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the \\\"incident\\\" in her story. Because it did not happen! \\nThe writer says she didn't publicize the incident at the time because she was ashamed, afraid of the repercussions and blamed herself for what she says happened. \\n___ \\n8:05 a.m. \\nThe soap opera actress in the video that has rocked the presidential campaign says Donald Trump's comments were offensive. \\nBut actress Arianne Zucker says she wasn't shocked by it, given \\\"that type of personality.\\\" She says that's \\\"probably why it doesn't mean a lot to me.\\\" \\nZucker spoke in an interview broadcast Thursday on NBC's \\\"Today.\\\" \\nZucker is the actress who meets Trump and TV personality Billy Bush on a soap opera set in the 2005 video. In the video, Trump boasts of using his fame to kiss and grab women. Trump, before greeting Zucker, tells Bush he needs to use Tic Tacs in case he starts kissing her. \\nTrump has said he regrets the remarks, which he describes as \\\"locker room\\\" banter. Zucker describes that as \\\"an interesting apology.\\\" \\n___ \\n3:10 a.m. \\nAmerica's campaign for president is quickly devolving into an ugly fight over who has treated women worse: Donald Trump, whose White House bid is floundering, or Bill Clinton, who isn't on the ballot. \\nTrump's campaign is now openly signaling it will spend the election's final month re-litigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as his wife and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's unverified role in intimidating the women who were involved. But Trump is a deeply imperfect messenger: his attacks on the Clintons' treatment of women are being overshadowed by a flood of allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent. \\nThe New York Times and the Palm Beach Post reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them.  \",\n",

We’re going to work up until Christmas.”\\nCarter Alan , music director and DJ on Radio.com affiliate station WZLX in Boston, said that this is typical for the band.\\n“The problem on this forthcoming album is one they’ve had in the past – they keep coming up with great new material that they record constantly, rendering the older material obsolete,” Alan, author of U2: The Road to Pop told WZLX.com. “The album never gets done!”\\nSongs Of Experience will be the band’s 14th studio album, and they’re hoping to have it out in the early Spring.\\n“I wish we were a little bit more definite about our scheduling because people have been expecting it,” Clayton continued in the interview. “But it’ll be out next year, maybe March/April. That’s the plan, but I’m not confirming it.”\\nRead the rest of this story at WZLX .\",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"\\nBy  Jason Easley  on  Thu, Oct 13th, 2016 at 10:35 am The impact of Trump's plunge in the polls is hitting the ground as the Trump campaign has pulled out of Virginia and conceded the state to Hillary Clinton. \\nThe impact of Trump’s plunge in the polls is hitting the ground as the Trump campaign has pulled out of Virginia and conceded the state to Hillary Clinton. The Wall Street Journal reported: \\nDonald Trump’s campaign has decided to pull its field operation out of Virginia, all but conceding the state to Democrat Hillary Clinton, an adviser to Mr. Trump confirmed. The move came Wednesday night as Mr. Trump faced a new avalanche of allegations from women who told several different publications that the Republican nominee had groped or touched them without consent. Trump just held a rally in the state before the first presidential debate. Trump spent a lot of time in Virginia, so his decision to just give up looks like another amateur hour decision choice from a campaign that has no clue what it is doing. Donald Trump is conceding a swing state to Hillary Clinton nearly four weeks before election day. Like all losing campaigns, the Trump camp is claiming that they are going to deploy the Virginia resources in other battleground states, but a look at the map reveals that there are few battleground states left to contest. Trump is losing Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and virtually every other swing state on the map. The Trump campaign is disintegrating before the eyes of voters across America. Outside of red baseball caps and tons of yard signs, Donald Trump’s campaign footprint is decreasing and slowly fading away. http://www.politicususa.com/ \",\n",

First lady Michelle Obama speaks during a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, in Manchester, N.H.   By MICHAEL CASEYAssociated Press \\nMANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Michelle Obama said Thursday she has been \\\"shaken\\\" to the core by comments that GOP Republican nominee Donald Trump made in which he is heard on a 2005 tape bragging about assaulting women because he is famous. \\nSpeaking at campaign rally in New Hampshire for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama called the comments \\\"shocking and demeaning.\\\" She also dismissed suggestion that they were simply \\\"locker room talk,\\\" saying they were affront to all women, parents and every citizen in United States. \\n\\\"I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken to me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted,\\\" the first lady said. \\\"So while I would love nothing more than pretend that this isn't happening and come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous to just move onto the next thing like this was all a bad dream. This is not something we can ignore.\\\" \\nObama said the comments made by Trump are part of a long history of demeaning women. \\n\\\"We have a candidate for president of the United States who over the course of his lifetime, over the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are shocking, so demeaning,\\\" she said. \\\"I simply will not repeat anything here today. Last week, we actually saw this candidate bragging about sexually assaulting women. I can't believe I'm saying that, a candidate for president of the United States bragged about sexually assaulting women.\\\" \\nObama went onto say that this was not something that should be dismissed, adding that women were hearing these comments and recollecting painful memories of when they were harassed in their offices or sexually assaulted. \\nThe GOP nominee has lost support in New Hampshire following the release of a 2005 video in which Trump is heard bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said over the weekend that she no longer plans to vote for him.  \",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"October 13, 2016 - 12:02pm  Previous 1 of 7  Next \\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Rocked by allegations of sexual assault, Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at his female accusers as \\\"horrible, horrible liars\\\" as the deeply divisive presidential campaign sank further into charges and countercharges of predatory treatment of women. \\nThe Republican businessman devoted much of a Florida speech to defending himself against multiple reports of inappropriate sexual behaviour — accusations that he blamed on Hillary Clinton's campaign and the news media. \\n\\\"These vicious claims about me, of inappropriate conduct with women, are totally and absolutely false. And the Clintons know it,\\\" Trump declared. His accusers, he said, \\\"are horrible people. They're horrible, horrible liars.\\\" \\nThe comments came minutes after he called a reporter \\\"a sleazebag\\\" for asking whether Trump had ever touched or groped a woman without her consent. \\nFirst lady Michelle Obama, meanwhile, offered an emotional counterargument in battleground New Hampshire, warning that Trump's behaviour sends a dangerous message to the nation's children. \\n\\\"The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman, it is cruel, it is frightening, and the truth is it hurts,\\\" Obama said. She added, \\\"We can't expose our children to this any longer, not for another minute, let alone for four years.\\\" \\nThe New York Times and the Palm Beach Post on Wednesday reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them. Separately, a People Magazine reporter wrote a detailed first-person account of being attacked by Trump while interviewing the businessman and his wife, Melania Trump. \\nTrump said the claims \\\"are all fabricated.\\\" \\n\\\"They're pure fiction, and they're outright lies. These events never happened,\\\" he said at the West Palm Beach rally. \\nHe added, \\\"I will not allow the Clinton machine to turn our campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies.\\\" \\nAt the same time, Trump's flailing campaign signalled it would spend the election's final month relitigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as what Trump says is Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's role in intimidating the women who were involved. \\nThe developments come less than a week after the publication of a 2005 recording in which the Republican nominee boasted of using his fame to kiss and grab women without their consent. \\nIn an interview broadcast Thursday, the soap opera actress in the video said Trump's comments were offensive. But actress Arianne Zucker, on NBC's \\\"Today,\\\" said she wasn't shocked, given \\\"that type of personality.\\\" \\nThe revelation of the video last Friday prompted many Republicans to withdraw their support for Trump — with some calling for him to drop out of the race — though a handful have since switched back to supporting him. \\nClinton adviser Jennifer Palmieri said the latest revelations match \\\"everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women.\\\" \\nTaken together, the stories about Trump and his retorts about Bill Clinton have plunged an already rancorous campaign to new lows. The real estate mogul has also aggressively charged that Hillary Clinton not only needs to be defeated in November but also imprisoned: \\\"Honestly, she should be locked up,\\\" he said Thursday. \\nAnd his campaign is facing questions about ties to Russian interests accused of hacking Democratic groups, as well as the hacking of a top Clinton adviser's emails. \\nFor Trump, the cumulative effect appears to be a tumble in the battleground states he needs to win in November. What was already a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory is virtually indiscernible for Trump unless there's a significant shake-up in the race between now and Nov. 8 \\nRather than trying to make up ground by shifting attention back to issues like trade that have energized Trump backers and could appeal to new voters, the Republican campaign appears to be moving swiftly to make Bill Clinton's past a centerpiece of its campaign. \\nBuilding on Trump's decision to bring three Bill Clinton accusers to last week's presidential debate, the Republican nominee is expected to have the women appear with him on stage at rallies and do television interviews, according to a person briefed on the plan but not authorized to discuss it publicly. They were not on stage in West Palm Beach. \\nThe Trump campaign's hope is to showcase the decades-old accusations to young voters, particularly women, who may not have been old enough to remember the controversies that dogged the Clintons in the 1990s. If the campaign can't get them to vote for Trump, the hope is that they will stay home and depress turnout, which would likely hurt Democrats. \\nBut it's unclear whether Trump's strategy is even aimed at winning the election at this point. \\nIncreasingly, Trump's campaign feels like an opportunity for longtime Clinton opponents to air decades worth of grievances about the Democratic power couple on the biggest stage in American politics. \\nTrump confidant and informal adviser Roger Stone has long encouraged Trump to make Bill Clinton's alleged assaults and the way his wife treated his accusers a centerpiece of the campaign. Steve Bannon, the campaign's chief executive, ran Breitbart News, a conservative website that eagerly promotes conspiracy theories about the Clintons. \\nHillary Clinton, who is on pace to become America's first female president if her lead holds, has tried to stay above the fray. She has yet to respond directly to Trump's decision to resurrect accusations about her husband. \\nBack in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama said, \\\"Enough is enough.\\\" \\n\\\"This has got to stop right now. Because consider this: If all of this is painful to us as grown women, what do you think this is doing to our children?\\\" \\n___ \\nAP writers Jonathan Lemire in Doral, Florida, and Jill Colvin contributed to this report. \\n___ \\nFollow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC \\nJonathan Lemire And Steve Peoples, The Associated Press \\n©2016 The Canadian Press\",\n",

He was appearing today on ABC’s “The View.” Trump has been talking about Bill Clinton’s affairs and making unproven charges of sexual assault. \\nKaine said the latest allegations from several women who said Trump touched or kissed them without permission are “shocking.” \\nKaine is also playing down the latest batch of hacked emails of Clinton campaign staffers. \\nHe says you “can’t automatically assume” the hacked emails are real. \\nIt’s impossible to authenticate each hacked email published by Wikileaks, but Democrats have not pointed to specific cases in which emails were altered.  \",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"2016 race devolves into ugly fight over treatment of women   1:00 PM Already deeply divisive, America's campaign for president is quickly devolving into an ugly fight over who has treated women worse: Donald Trump, whose White House bid is floundering, or former President Bill Clinton, who isn't on the ballot. The Associated Press \\nLAS VEGAS — Already deeply divisive, America's campaign for president is quickly devolving into an ugly fight over who has treated women worse: Donald Trump, whose White House bid is floundering, or former President Bill Clinton, who isn't on the ballot. \\nTrump's campaign is now openly signaling it will spend the election's final month relitigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as his wife and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's unverified role in intimidating the women who were involved. But Trump is a deeply imperfect messenger, given that his attacks on the Clintons' treatment of women are being overshadowed by a flood of allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent. \\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times and the Palm Beach Post reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them. Separately, a People Magazine reporter wrote a detailed first-person account of being attacked by Trump while interviewing the businessman and his wife, Melania Trump. \\nThe stories come less than a week after the publication of a 2005 recording in which the Republican nominee boasted of using his fame to kiss and grab women. The revelation prompted a flood of Republicans to revoke their support for Trump, with some even calling for him to drop out of the race — though a handful of GOP officials have since switched back to supporting their party's nominee. \\nClinton adviser Jennifer Palmieri said the latest revelations match \\\"everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women.\\\" \\nTrump's campaign denied the reports and threatened to sue The New York Times if the paper did not retract its story. \\nTaken together, the revelations about Trump and his counterprogramming about Bill Clinton have plunged an already rancorous campaign to new lows. The real estate mogul has also aggressively charged that Hillary Clinton not only needs to be defeated in November, but also \\\"has got to go to jail.\\\" His campaign is also facing questions about ties to Russian interests accused of hacking Democratic groups, as well as the hacking of a top Clinton adviser's emails. \\nFor Trump, the cumulative effect of his brazen strategy appears to be a tumble in the battleground states he needs to win in November. What was already a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory is virtually indiscernible for Trump unless there's a significant shakeup in the race between now and Nov. 8 \\nRather than trying to make up ground by shifting attention back to issues like trade that have energized Trump backers and could appeal to new voters, the Republican campaign appears to be moving swiftly to make Bill Clinton's past a centerpiece of the campaign. \\nBuilding on Trump's decision to bring three Bill Clinton accusers to last week's presidential debate, the GOP nominee is expected to have the women appear with him on stage at rallies and do a series of television interviews, according to a person briefed on the plan but not authorized to discuss it publicly. \\nTrump supporters are also confronting Hillary Clinton with the accusations about her husband. Multiple Clinton rallies were interrupted this week by hecklers shouting \\\"Bill Clinton is a rapist.\\\" Earlier this week, right-wing radio host Alex Jones offered to pay $5,000 to anyone who can be heard on television shouting about the former president and wearing a \\\"Bill Clinton rape\\\" T-shirt. \\nBill Clinton never faced any criminal charges over the allegations, and a lawsuit over an alleged rape was dismissed. He did settle a lawsuit with one of the women who claimed harassment. \\nThe Trump campaign's hope is to showcase the decades-old accusations to young voters, particularly women, who may not have been old enough to remember the controversies that dogged the Clintons in the 1990s. And if the campaign can't get them to vote for Trump, the person briefed on the plans said the goal is to convince young voters to stay home and depress turnout, which would likely hurt Democrats. \\nFormer Trump senior adviser Michael Caputo said the businessman's only way to win is to \\\"go nuclear\\\" on the Clintons. \\n\\\"There's no way Trump can do anything positive to earn back women,\\\" Caputo said. \\\"The only way he can stave off the bleeding is to drag them into parity.\\\" \\nBut it's unclear whether Trump's strategy is even aimed at winning the election at this point. Increasingly, Trump's campaign feels like an opportunity for longtime Clinton opponents to air decade's worth of grievances about the Democratic power couple on the biggest stage in American politics. \\nTrump confidante and informal adviser Roger Stone has long been encouraging Trump to make Bill Clinton's alleged assaults and the way his wife treated those woman a centerpiece of the campaign. Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign's chief executive, ran Breitbart News, a right-wing website that eagerly promotes an endless string of conspiracy theories about the Clintons. \\nHillary Clinton, who is on pace to become America's first female president is her lead holds, has tried to stay above the fray in recent days. She is yet to respond directly to Trump's decision to resurrect accusations about her husband. \\nAnd during a pair of rallies Wednesday in Colorado and Nevada, Clinton appeared to be looking toward how to heal the country's deep divisions if she's elected president, pledging she would be a champion both for her supporters and those who don't vote for her. \\n\\\"I know how important it is that we stay focused on the concerns that people have, not on the demagoguery and distraction,\\\" she said.

      "      \"text\": \"PRESIDENTIAL RACE | Campaign devolves into ugly fight over treatment of women | Tweet Published: Thu, October 13, 2016 @ 12:05 p.m. \\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Deeply divisive all year, America’s campaign for president has devolved into charges and countercharges of predatory treatment of women. As Donald Trump is rocked by allegations of sexual assault, he is fighting back by shaming former President Bill Clinton, who isn’t on the ballot, for his infidelities. \\nTrump’s campaign is now signaling it will spend the election’s final month relitigating Clinton’s marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as what Trump says is Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s role in intimidating the women who were involved. \\nBut Trump is a deeply imperfect messenger, given that almost everything he says is being overshadowed by a flood of allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent. \\nJust four days ago, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway promoted a tweet from Clinton declaring that “every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported.” \\n“‘Every’ the operative word here,” wrote Conway, whose campaign is now attacking the credibility of the new allegations against Trump. \\nThe New York Times and the Palm Beach Post on Wednesday reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them. Separately, a People Magazine reporter wrote a detailed first-person account of being attacked by Trump while interviewing the businessman and his wife, Melania Trump. \\nTrump on Thursday took to Twitter to denounce the Times story as a “total fabrication,” and to assert that the incident cited by People “did not happen.” His campaign threatened to sue. \\nThe stories come less than a week after the publication of a 2005 recording in which the Republican nominee boasted of using his fame to kiss and grab women. \\nIn an interview broadcast Thursday, the soap opera actress in the video said Trump’s comments were offensive. But actress Arianne Zucker, on NBC’s “Today,” said she wasn’t shocked, given “that type of personality.” She said that’s “probably why it doesn’t mean a lot to me.” \\nThe revelation of the video last Friday prompted many Republicans to withdraw their support for Trump — with some calling for him to drop out of the race — though a handful have since switched back to supporting him. \\nClinton adviser Jennifer Palmieri said the latest revelations match “everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women.” \\nTaken together, the stories about Trump and his retorts about Bill Clinton have plunged an already rancorous campaign to new lows. The real estate mogul has also aggressively charged that Hillary Clinton not only needs to be defeated in November but also “has got to go to jail.” And his campaign is facing questions about ties to Russian interests accused of hacking Democratic groups, as well as the hacking of a top Clinton adviser’s emails. \\nFor Trump, the cumulative effect appears to be a tumble in the battleground states he needs to win in November. What was already a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory is virtually indiscernible for Trump unless there’s a significant shake-up in the race between now and Nov. 8 \\nRather than trying to make up ground by shifting attention back to issues like trade that have energized Trump backers and could appeal to new voters, the Republican campaign appears to be moving swiftly to make Bill Clinton’s past a centerpiece of its campaign. \\nBuilding on Trump’s decision to bring three Bill Clinton accusers to last week’s presidential debate, the Republican nominee is expected to have the women appear with him on stage at rallies and do television interviews, according to a person briefed on the plan but not authorized to discuss it publicly. \\nTrump supporters are also confronting Hillary Clinton with the accusations about her husband. Multiple Clinton rallies were interrupted this week by hecklers shouting “Bill Clinton is a rapist.” \\nBill Clinton never faced any criminal charges over the allegations, and a lawsuit over an alleged rape was dismissed. He did settle a lawsuit with one of the women who claimed harassment.  \",\n",

      "      \"text\": \"Hillary Clinton might lose Ohio because she badmouthed coal   \\nCLEVELAND (CNNMoney) Charlie Saltkield won t vote for Hillary Clinton in November for one reason: She badmouthed coal. Saltkield doesn t even work in the coal industry. He owns Charlie s Cycles, a motorcycle shop in southern Ohio, about an hour south of Columbus. He s exactly the kind of voter Clinton should be able to woo: He grew up a Democrat and he s done OK in the Obama era. But Donald Trump gets Saltkield s vote this year. \\nMy dad was a coal miner. You can t go against the coal miners. It s my heritage, Saltkield told CNNMoney over lunch in mid-September at Diner 23 in Waverly, Ohio. \\nOhio has voted for the winner of every presidential race since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. It s the reason people say, As goes Ohio, so goes the nation. The usual voting blocs in Ohio are muddled this year. Union and coal voters like Saltkield are crossing party lines to vote for Trump. Meanwhile, some Republicans, including Governor John Kasich, just can t stomach Trump. On top of that, basketball star LeBron James, a hero in Ohio after winning the 2016 NBA championship, has endorsed Clinton. Political pundits don t talk about coal much. But in southern Ohio, it s on everyone s minds. Trains rumble by hourly, often loaded with coal. More than Benghazi, or deleted emails, what people in this part of America remember about Clinton is what she said about coal. \\nWe re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, Clinton stated at a CNN Democratic Town Hall in Columbus, Ohio. \\nThat was back in March. But when CNNMoney visited Ohio six months later, it was remarkable to see how many people remembered that line, word for word. Clinton s very next line at that fateful town hall was, And we re going to make it clear that we don t want to forget those people. But not a single soul that CNNMoney spoke to remembered the second line. Clinton went on to promise to help get coal workers into green energy jobs. Randy Barr just shakes his head at Clinton s green energy jobs vow. \\nI think they ll say anything to get elected, said Barr, a waste management supervisor, who plans to vote for Trump. I want someone new, fresh. I want an outsider. \\nBarr and Saltkield live in Pike County, Ohio, a place that Mitt Romney won by a single vote in 2012. It s the ultimate battleground town in a state that s a toss-up, and Clinton isn t doing well there. Not even the bombshell video of Trump making lewd and sexually aggressive comments about women has changed these voters minds. Of all the Trump voters CNNMoney met in Ohio (we interviewed 8 on camera), only one is now on the fence because of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape. \\nI don t want Hillary in there. I ll do everything I can to stop her, Barr said. About a mile down the road from where CNNMoney met Barr and Saltfield lies the Boilmakers Local 105, one of the main union outposts in southern Ohio. A sign out front says, Foreign made vehicles and products are not appreciated on this property. \\nDonald Trump likes to tout his tremendous support among union members. Workers love me, he has said. In reality, a lot of union workers don t like either Trump or Clinton. \\nI m 49 years old. I ve voted in every election since I was 18. I m disgusted, says Scott Hammond. He s spent his adult life working on boilers at power plants mostly coal-fired power plants. He calls this election the biggest reality show in the history of America. He likens Trump s campaign to a Jerry Springer special. (Springer recently tweeted that Trump belongs on my show. ) \\nHammond is a union guy. Like many union members, he usually votes for a Democrat. President Obama got his vote both times. But he fears Clinton will be even worse for coal. \\nI m angry for what [Obama] has done to our business, says Hammond, who is now the business manager of the Boilermakers Local 105. I think global warming is highly overrated. \\nHammond isn t sure what he ll do on Election Day. He predicts it will come down to a coin toss for him and most of his fellow union members. That s not a good sign for Clinton. Over 12% of Ohio workers are union members, slightly above the national average. As angry as Hammond is at Obama and Clinton, he sees Trump s appeal to working class men as a total farce. \\nWhen Donald Trump went to Charleston, West Virginia, and put on the hard hat, and pretended to be shoveling coal, that was one of the biggest jokes that I ve seen in this whole campaign, says Hammond. About 200 miles away, it s a very different story in booming Cleveland. \\nOnce written off as part of the declining Rust Belt, Cleveland has reinvented itself. Smoke stacks from old factories still greet people as they enter the city, but the employer that gets all the buzz now is Cleveland Clinic, a world-class medical facility, that attracts foreign royalty from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Cleveland s population has held steady at 388,072 in recent years, a cause for celebration after decades of decline. The downtown is teeming with spruced up restaurants and condos. Apartment prices are shooting up because so many young professional are clamoring to live there. \\nI think [Cleveland] is cool because the cost of living is really reasonable, says Bridget Gallant, who recently bought a home in a gentrifying part of Cleveland at age 27. She s supporting Clinton. And then there s LeBron James. Everyone in town wants to remind you that James and the Cleveland Cavaliers just won the NBA Championship. A mammoth poster of James hangs right by the Cleveland Indians baseball stadium downtown. It s as tall as the old smoke stacks. \\nJames, a demi-god in Cleveland, endorsed Clinton in early October, saying, she will build on the legacy of my good friend, President Barack Obama. Democrats are fearful that the African-American community, which turned out in record numbers to vote for Barack Obama, won t come out as strongly for Clinton in 2016. African-Americans make up over half of Cleveland s population. The concerns may be overblown. \\nActually, I m more excited about her [than Obama]. I really like Hillary, said Sierra Lesley, a stay-at-home mom, told CNNMoney. I think Donald Trump is not qualified to be the president. \\nCNNMoney spent several hours outside Dave s Market, a grocery store in a predominately African-American neighborhood on the east side of town. Nearly everyone we met was voting for Clinton. In fact, these were some of the most enthusiastic voters we met for Clinton in all our travels through swing states. Jeannie Whittaker, nearly 70 and a great grandma to 21, started chanting Hill-ah-ry! Hill-ah-ry! during her interview and waving at a passerby who gave her the thumbs up for Clinton. Trump is just for the rich. I mean, he s loaded, said Whittaker, a retired security officer who is now on Social Security. Poor people aren t loaded. We don t have any money, but we tryin . \\nWhittaker s neighborhood is mainly public housing. It needs so many things, she says. Mainly, she hopes Clinton will usher in an era of more jobs. \\nDowntown [Cleveland] looks beautiful. They really built it up, but what about the other parts? she laments. In many ways, the poverty in East Cleveland is very similar to Pike County. Many people receive government aid, especially disability and Medicaid, in both places. But while those in southern Ohio are leaning more toward Trump to rescue their woes, it s Clinton country in the city. \\nHillary Clinton is my girl this year, I can t see it any other way, says Samantha Martin, a young professional who moved to Cleveland after college from a red part of Ohio. She and her brother are the first in their family to graduate from college. Martin, who is struggling to pay off $60,000 in student loans, works at a food bank in Cleveland. That s the other side of this really incredible housing boom: All these people getting pushed away by high property rates, she says. \\nBut even in East Cleveland, there are signs of a healing economy. Rowena Washington lives on a block that used to be dilapidated public housing. Now it s middle class homes. These were redone a decade ago with a goal of having people actually buy them. It s become the type of neighborhood where there s a friendly rivalry over which home has the best flowers. \\nEverybody that comes through [this neighborhood], they say, Oh, Wow! It looks different,’ said Washington as she watered her perennials out front. It s peaceful and quiet. \\nWashington moved to the area in 2008. She works in a health care profession and is a big Clinton supporter. Anyone would be crazy not to get out and vote for Hillary, said Washington, who went out to vote for Clinton on Ohio s rainy primary day in March. Clinton beat Bernie Sanders by a lot in Ohio. The election in Ohio is likely to come down to voter turnout and the final decisions of people like the union workers and Angie Shanks. \\nShanks owns a real estate company in Pike County. She voted for Obama but isn t happy with how it turned out, especially when the cost of her health insurance tripled. When CNNMoney met her in September, she was leaning toward Trump. \\nI think Trump is a businessman and the country is a business. It needs to be run as a business, Shanks said then. After listening to Trump s vulgar remarks on the 2005 tape, she s not sure she can vote for him anymore. But checking a box for Clinton is tough too. \\nI m not sure about Hillary. I m not sure she s for the Americans as much as she is for herself, Shanks said. CNN s Poppy Harlow, Jordan Malter and Richa Naik contributed to this report.\",\n",

ADVERTISEMENT The first lady's speech was a tour de force on behalf of the rights of women to reach their full potential, the rights of women to be safe from those who would abuse them, and the rights of women to resist, oppose and defeat those who would do them ill.\\nObama's New Hampshire speech comes after a long history of GOP nominee Donald Trump Donald Trump CNN media correspondent: Trump's speech was 'paranoid' and 'dangerous' Michelle Obama soars, Donald Trump shrinks FULL SPEECH: Trump defends against sex assault accusations MORE making sexist and abusive comments attacking a long list of women. Her speech comes after Trump spent almost a week maligning and attacking Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe he was up in the middle of the night attacking in a ludicrous tweetstorm. \\nObama's New Hampshire speech came after Trump was revealed on video, telling his own story in his own voice, using words about women so file and nauseating they cannot even be repeated in a family newspaper. \\nObama's New Hampshire speech came after a growing list of women have come forward with allegations about Trump's behavior that would be, if true, real-life abuses that are far beyond Trump's suggestion that his vile and nauseating words were merely \\\"locker-room talk\\\" — which was an insult to athletes, male or female, as well as women. \\nTrump, as usual, claims it is the media's fault, that the media are all against him. He claims that Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Ryan Michelle Obama soars, Donald Trump shrinks Well, that was quick: Republicans give Trump a free pass Gingrich: 'Little Trump is frankly pathetic' MORE (R-Wis.) is part of a sinister conspiracy against him. The man who once said the president of the United States was not born in America now says that all of the women who have come forth are liars. \\nIt was jarring to watch Obama, who represents the best of America and the noblest vision of politics, followed on TV by Trump, who embodies the worst of a politics that will soon be rejected en masse by the American people, led by American women. \\nThe first lady spoke about the rights of women to better their lives in whatever manner they choose, and to be treated by men with the respect that should be offered to every other human being. \\nIn her speech, the first lady soared into the stratosphere of eloquence and nobility as she called on women to be proud of everything they have accomplished, to be determined to resist those who abuse them and to exercise the power that women have to affect the course of our democracy by voting. \\nObama demonstrated again today why she is one of the most respected figures — male or female — in American politics and why Clinton is one of the most qualified candidates in modern history — male or female — for the presidency of the United States. \\nToday, the first lady, in an eloquent and memorable speech, put Donald Trump in his place without ever mentioning his name. She made a statement about what is best about America, followed by a speech by Trump, which revealed yet again why Trump's place is to stand in the lexicon of losers who should never be allowed near the Oval Office except as a tourist seeking an autograph — not as commander in chief. \\nBudowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Chief Deputy Majority Whip Bill Alexander (D-Ark.). He holds an LL.M. degree in international financial law from the London School of Economics.

I’m not offended as a husband or a father. I’m offended as a guy.” \\n“He was at work, man. He wasn’t in a locker room. He was at work. He was showing up to do a thing on camera,” Hanks said of Trump’s remarks, which were made on the Access Hollywood bus as the Apprentice host prepared to discuss his cameo on Days of Our Lives. \\nGrowing more agitated, Hanks added, “That’s just not right, I’m sorry. It’s not right at work, it’s not right in the locker room. It’s wrong, period. The end. That’s all.” \\nHe further slammed the real estate mogul turned presidential candidate for his lack of government experience. \\n“It’s kind of like if you have a horrible, painful tooth, and you need a root canal,” said Hanks. “Who are you going to see? A guy who says, ‘Oh, I think I can figure that out, how to do a root canal for you. Lay down.’ Or are you going to see somebody who’s done 6,000 of them, has a degree on the wall and has a great history and expertise when it comes down to it.” Also Read: ‘I’d punch his face': Robert De Niro goes ballistic chastising Donald Trump  \",\n",

The contamination has been tied to 28 cases in the U.S., including at least four who died. But officials think hundreds or thousands of other patients could have been infected. \\nThe outbreaks have been tracked to certain heater-cooler devices, which are used to keep patients' hearts cold and bodies warm during some heart operations. \\nThe manufacturer of the devices identified the contamination in its factory in Germany in 2014 and reportedly cleaned it up. But bacteria traced to the machines were linked to clusters of illnesses in Switzerland, Pennsylvania, Iowa and Michigan. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Arnold Schwarzenegger claimed he didn't know he know who'd be voting for , and John McCain withdrew his support, while proudly announcing that he wouldn't be voting for Clinton .\\nSEE ALSO: Muslims throw Trumps' answer back in his face in the most clever way \\nEveryone's vote matters, but both Navarro and John McCain come from battleground states where their votes statistically, at least, matter more. Even though traditionally conservative media outlets have called Trump \\\" dangerous \\\" and GOP leaders have warned that he's a \\\" security risk ,\\\" these leaders can't simply muster the strength to put a stop it — by casting one vote on behalf of the only candidate popular enough to stop him.

      "      \"text\": \"(credit: Kenny Cole )\\nRace and politics will once again intersect at the Supreme Court when the Justices hear McCrory v. Harris and Bethune Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections . Both cases deal with the issue of gerrymandering, and whether certain congressional districts were purposely doctored in a way that is discriminatory toward minorities or makes their vote irrelevant.\\nGerrymandering is the process of manipulating the boundaries of an electoral constituency so as to favor one political party or demographic group. Every 10 years, after the census is taken, state legislatures get to redraw the congressional map of their state based on the new population data; some states may have to get rid of a district altogether. This process is called redistricting. Gerrymandering occurs when the state legislature’s new map seems to pack a particular group into a certain district where their voices will only be heard there, or to spread them out so much that they do not have much of a say at all.\\nThis practice has long dominated American politics, starting with the first Congress. Virginia Governor Patrick Henry had the state legislature gerrymander the 5th District so he could pit his enemy James Madison against James Monroe in that House race. Madison ultimately beat Monroe, but it was much closer than if the district had not been touched.\\nThe term itself comes from the Boston Gazette, which published a story on the redistricting plan Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry signed into law in 1812. The reporter noted that one district resembled the shape of a salamander, and thus “gerrymander ” was born.\\nThe 14th Amendment , as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , help to combat racial bias in gerrymandering. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act even has a clause that requires some states to have their redistricting plans approved by the Department of Justice before being implemented in an attempt to ensure there is no voter discrimination. This formula in Section 4 that identifies those states, however, was found to be unconstitutional in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder . This opened the door for states like North Carolina and Virginia to enact election laws without approval by the federal government.\\nMcCrory v. Harris deals with North Carolina congressional districts 1 and 12. These districts are Democratic, but some constituents claim that they are packed with minorities and therefore racially gerrymandered. North Carolina officials, claiming that they were simply following the Voting Rights Act, made majority-minority districts with a 50% minimum of African-American residents. But since African Americans were already being elected to office and given a fair shot at picking the representatives they wanted, it could be seen as minority packing—which is exactly how the North Carolina Supreme Court saw it.\\nBethune Hill v. Virginia is centered on 12 of Virginia’s state legislative districts. These districts, 12 in total, required a 55% minority population in their districts; like North Carolina, the state justified the requirement as necessary for compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The lower court in this case decided in favor of the state—meaning that, as of now, those districts are still legal.\\nWhat both affected parties are really pointing to in these cases is the decision in Shaw v. Reno in 1993. There, the Supreme Court said that, yes, race needs to be considered when redistricting, but that race cannot be the predominant factor.\\nBoth of these cases must also tackle the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which says that minorities should be given a fair chance to elect representatives of their choice, but not to be packed into a district in order to limit their broader influence.\\nFor North Carolina, McCrory v. Harris is just the latest gerrymandering case to reach the nation’s highest court. In 1996, the Supreme Court said in Shaw v. Hunt that North Carolina had made a majority-minority district for race reasons, not party reasons, and the Court ruled it unconstitutional. In 2001, however, the Court ruled in Hunt v. Cromartie that the redrawn district was drawn based on party, not race, and therefore was allowed to remain intact. In many cases, the Court has drawn a fine line: gerrymandering based primarily on party is acceptable, but gerrymandering based primarily on race is not.\\nWith the Court deadlocked right now with only eight Justices, there is a good chance that both of these cases will be 4-4 decisions, although Justice Anthony Kennedy has swung to the left on this issue before. Tackling the question of “ race or party ” has never been an easy one for the courts, and these two cases are no different.\\nChris Calabrese is an intern at the National Constitution Center.

Thursday, October 13 2016 5:32 AM EDT 2016-10-13 09:32:34 GMT Updated: Thursday, October 13 2016 5:35 AM EDT 2016-10-13 09:35:48 GMT \\n“Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half-naked changing into our bikinis,” said Tasha Dixon, who was 18 when she competed in the Miss USA pageant in 2001. \\n“Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half-naked changing into our bikinis,” said Tasha Dixon, who was 18 when she competed in the Miss USA pageant in 2001. \\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on the U.S. presidential race (all times EDT): \\n2:15 p.m. \\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is not taking questions from a friendly audience of Wisconsin business leaders even though his office originally said he would. \\nRyan on Thursday gave a speech at the Waukesha County Business Alliance. He got a standing ovation as he entered, but left immediately after his remarks. His office had said in the original notice that he would take 30 minutes of questions. Ryan's campaign spokesman Zack Roday says he had to leave due to a tight schedule. \\nRyan did not refer to Donald Trump by name during the speech, but bemoaned the lack of focus on issues Republicans want to talk about. He says, \\\"Guess what? We are actually running on ideas in this election.\\\" \\nRyan has endorsed Trump, but said last week he wouldn't campaign for him. \\n2:05 p.m. \\nDonald Trump is saying the attacks on him are \\\"a conspiracy against the American people\\\" by the political and media establishment. \\nTrump, speaking Thursday in Florida after being rocked by sexual assault allegations, said the press \\\"will seek to destroy your career and your family.\\\" \\nThe Republican nominee said: \\\"They will seek to destroy everything about you including your reputation.\\\" \\nBut he said that he would \\\"take the slings and arrows\\\" in order to protect his supporters and vowed that America would have a \\\"new Independence Day\\\" on Election Day. \\nTrump denied the allegations made by several women that he touched and kissed them without their consent. \\n1:55 p.m. \\nThe New York Times is responding to Donald Trump's lawsuit threat by saying it welcomes the challenge. \\nThe response came from David E. McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel for the New York Times Company. He said in a letter Thursday that the public has a right to hear from women who say the Republican presidential nominee sexually assaulted them. \\nThe Times published a story Wednesday quoting two women who said Trump had touched or kissed them without their consent. Trump denies the allegations. \\nTrump has threatened to sue the newspaper. McCraw wrote to a lawyer for Trump that if Trump believes the law protects him from critics, \\\"we welcome an opportunity to have a court set him straight.\\\" \\n1:45 p.m. \\nThe questions about Donald Trump are clearly starting to get old for U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. \\nThe Republican is in a tight re-election campaign with Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander. Blunt supports Trump, but has distanced himself from the Republican presidential candidate. \\nAsked after a campaign appearance in suburban St. Louis on Thursday about new allegations by women accusing Trump of inappropriate behavior, Blunt said the issue \\\"is not what we ought to be talking about.\\\" \\nAsked if he is reconsidering his support, Blunt said the question has been \\\"asked and answered like 10 times in the last week, and the answer's still the same.\\\" \\nBlunt said he wants a president who can change the Affordable Care Act, reduce regulation, and improve foreign policy. \\n1:40 p.m. \\nRocked by sexual assault allegations, Donald Trump is saying that that his campaign is \\\"an existential threat\\\" to the political establishment. \\nTrump made his comments at a rally Thursday in West Palm Beach, Florida. It was his first appearance since several women stepped forward to say they had been groped and received unwanted advances from Trump. \\nThe Republican nominee said \\\"the political establishment'\\\" is trying to stop us and said that \\\"for the media, nothing is out of bounds.\\\" \\n1:30 p.m. \\nDonald Trump is denying allegations of sexual assault and calls them \\\"coordinated, vicious attack\\\" from the media and Hillary Clinton campaign. \\nTrump said Thursday at a rally in Florida that he has evidence to disprove allegations of sexual assault and will release it at the \\\"appropriate time.\\\" \\nSeveral women have come forward in a series of reports claiming that Trump groped or kissed them without their consent and made unwanted advances. \\nTrump said the claims \\\"are totally and absolutely false.\\\" He called them \\\"pure fiction and outright lies.\\\" \\n1:20 p.m. \\nDonald Trump has dodged reporter's question as to whether he has ever touched or kissed a woman without her consent. \\nTrump met with local business leaders Thursday before a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida. The rally comes amid a series of reports about women who claim Trump had groped them and made other unwanted sexual advances. \\nTrump did not answer the question as the roundtable attendees booed. \\nTrump then turned to the room and declared \\\"what a sleazebag.\\\" \\n1:09 p.m. \\nMichelle Obama said she \\\"was shaken to the core\\\" by comments that GOP Republican nominee Donald Trump made in which he is heard on a 2005 tape bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. \\nSpeaking at campaign rally in New Hampshire for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama called the comments \\\"shocking and demeaning. She also dismissed suggestion that they were simply \\\"locker room talk,\\\" saying they were affront to all women and parents. \\nThe GOP nominee has lost support in New Hampshire following the release of a 2005 video in which Trump is heard bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said over the weekend that she no longer plans to vote for him. \\n12:55 p.m. \\nFirst lady Michelle Obama says Donald Trump's crude sexual comments about women should not be seen as \\\"politics as usual.\\\" \\nMrs. Obama was speaking at a Hillary Clinton rally in New Hampshire. She called the Republican presidential nominee's language disgraceful and intolerable. \\nShe said that it should outrage all, regardless of political affiliation. She said he was bragging about sexually assaulting women. \\nMrs. Obama was referring to a 2005 video in which Trump is heard bragging about how his fame allowed him to \\\"do anything\\\" to women. He later dismissed his language as \\\"locker room talk.\\\" \\n12:10 p.m. \\nThere's unprecedented uncertainty about how conservative Utah will vote in the November election. \\nThat's because the usual cohesion of voters in the Republican stronghold has been blown up by Donald Trump's crudeness and volatility. \\nUtah is a must-win state for Trump, and he may end up squeaking out a victory. But the state's widespread aversion to the brash billionaire has soared following the release of a recording of Trump degrading women. \\nAn increasing number of Utah's mostly Mormon voters are considering going with third-party candidates Evan McMullin and Gary Johnson. \\nIt could mean an improbable Utah victory for Democrat Hillary Clinton if she captures just one-third of the state's votes. That's a level achieved several times in past three decades by Democratic candidates. \\n11:50 a.m. \\nTim Kaine says Hillary Clinton's marriage is \\\"not an issue for the voters,\\\" despite Donald Trump's efforts to highlight Bill Clinton's misconduct. \\nThe Democratic vice presidential nominee is reacting to the campaign's new focus on both candidates' treatment of women. He was appearing Thursday on ABC's \\\"The View.\\\" Trump has been talking about Bill Clinton's affairs and making unproven charges of sexual assault. \\nKaine said the latest allegations from several women who said Trump touched or kissed them without permission are \\\"shocking.\\\" \\nKaine is also playing down the latest batch of hacked emails of Clinton campaign staffers. \\nHe says you \\\"can't automatically assume\\\" the hacked emails are real. \\nIt's impossible to authenticate each hacked email published by Wikileaks, but Democrats have not pointed to specific cases in which emails were altered. \\n9:40 a.m. \\nDonald Trump is trying to discredit new allegations of groping and sexual assault. \\nThe Republican nominee says on Twitter that a New York Times story on two women who allege he groped them years ago is \\\"phony\\\" and a \\\"total fabrication.\\\" \\nTrump is also going after a People Magazine writer who alleges Trump pinned her against a wall and kissed her without consent in 2005 as she was interviewing him for a wedding anniversary story. \\nHe tweeted: \\\"Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the \\\"incident\\\" in her story. Because it did not happen! \\nThe writer says she didn't publicize the incident at the time because she was ashamed, afraid of the repercussions and blamed herself for what she says happened. \\n8:05 a.m. \\nThe soap opera actress in the video that has rocked the presidential campaign says Donald Trump's comments were offensive. \\nBut actress Arianne Zucker says she wasn't shocked by it, given \\\"that type of personality.\\\" She says that's \\\"probably why it doesn't mean a lot to me.\\\" \\nZucker spoke in an interview broadcast Thursday on NBC's \\\"Today.\\\" \\nZucker is the actress who meets Trump and TV personality Billy Bush on a soap opera set in the 2005 video. In the video, Trump boasts of using his fame to kiss and grab women. Trump, before greeting Zucker, tells Bush he needs to use Tic Tacs in case he starts kissing her. \\nTrump has said he regrets the remarks, which he describes as \\\"locker room\\\" banter. Zucker describes that as \\\"an interesting apology.\\\" \\n3:10 a.m. \\nAmerica's campaign for president is quickly devolving into an ugly fight over who has treated women worse: Donald Trump, whose White House bid is floundering, or Bill Clinton, who isn't on the ballot. \\nTrump's campaign is now openly signaling it will spend the election's final month re-litigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as his wife and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's unverified role in intimidating the women who were involved. But Trump is a deeply imperfect messenger: his attacks on the Clintons' treatment of women are being overshadowed by a flood of allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent. \\nThe New York Times and the Palm Beach Post reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them.
